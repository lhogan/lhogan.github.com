    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(Note:  Despite it being Monday, I'm in a generally good mood... so don't take this post as some sort of depressive negativity overwhelmed rant...)</p>

<p>I, like a lot of other people, wish I had more free time.  But, at the very least until I finsh my thesis (let's not go there, shall we?) and get past September's IEEE GOLD Congress, and knock off a few more "To-Dos" from my list, I probably won't.  But when I do get the time, there a number of things I'd like to do.  I know a lot of them, reasonably won't happen until I retire or something, unless I end up in a body-cast for some reason... but feel free to suggest other things!</p>

<ul>
<li>Learn to run without feeling like an idiot</li>
<li>Watch all episodes, marathon-style, of "Scrubs", "Farscape", and "Sex and the City"</li>
<li>Re-read "The Lord of the Rings" and "Harry Potter" books</li>
<li>Read the books that I've bought but haven't read yet</li>
<li>Take the dogs on a long car ride followed by a good hike</li>
<li>Camp more</li>
<li>Learn to golf (or at least hit a golf bal somewhat consistently in a predicted direction farther than five feet)</li>
<li>Learn to use the fancy-pants camera we have, more than just the pre-defined settings</li>
<li>Walk around St. John's and Mount Pearl and actually take pictures without feeling like an idiot or a tourist</li>
<li>Take a conversational French course</li>
<li>Drive to Gros Morne National Park and spend a week without contact</li>
<li>Visit family I haven't seen in a while</li>
<li>Work on my family tree</li>
</ul>
