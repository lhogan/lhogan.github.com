    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.lorihogan.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-08-10-10.22.40.jpg"><img src="http://www.lorihogan.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-08-10-10.22.40-300x196.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.lorihogan.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-08-10-10.22.40.jpg"></a>... and what do I have to show for it? A healthy, happy baby boy who seems to be reading the development charts and following them perfectly.  A dog who is a bit jealous, but is learning to live with less attention. An awesome hubby who has become an excellent, patient father. A house that's no cleaner or more organized than it ever was pre maternity leave, but that's okay, as long as the laundry gets done. A bit of a tan from those few sunny days we've had that I can stroll with Baby J.  A better appreciation for SAHMs and anyone undertaking childcare professionally.</p>

<p>... and what do I miss? Sleep (I'm getting some and I'm not complaining, just being honest). The ability to have a margarita without planning around it (breastfeeding is awesome is so many ways though). Work (yes, a bit). Travel (soon to be rectified, hopefully).</p>

<p>... and what surprises have there been? How quickly the months have gone by. How slow some days can seem. How interesting it can be to just watch Baby J from day to day. How much love and pride I can feel for my family. How a sunny day makes so much difference when you aren't in an office. How great coffee can be after a difficult night. How different things actually are. How little some other things have changed.</p>

<p>... and what do I have to work on for the next six months? Patience (especially at 5am). Organization. Taking advantage of those quiet moments to get things done or do nothing without feeling guilty. Reaching out and staying connected to friends. Learning to ask for help. Learning to say "No".</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow!!  I was having such a bad week with health and stress issues (save Tuesday's night banquet, see below) and then my West Coast friend <a href="http://applpolisher.blogspot.com">Divinity </a>(through whom I've travelled vicariously quite a bit! :)) sends me these!  Not only are the flowers beautiful, but the vase is all stripey and perfect for any type of flower in the future (I may try some bamboo in my office in the near future).  I am very appreciative... thanks chick!  I'll remember you (and your address) as I head out on some business trips in the next few months.</p>

<p>Earlier this week was <a href="http://www.oceansar2006.com">OceanSAR 2006</a>, a radar-for-ocean-technologies workshop for which I was web-master (or is it web-mistress?).  Anyhoo, at the workshop banquet at the <a href="http://www.fairmont.com/newfoundland/">Fairmont </a>Tuesday night (blackened halibut for main course, chocolate mousse cake for dessert... yummy), the organizing committee recognized the work of myself and a colleague who did FAR more than I in planning for this thing with a basket of flowers.  They did leak when I brought them back to the table, but luckily the tablecloth covered up my "mess".</p>

<p>The health is improving.  I visited the <a href="http://www.mun.ca/student/health/">Student Health Centre</a> yesterday (and tried to ignore the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwalk_virus">Norwalk </a>buzz that filled the waiting room), got assurances that my cold will improve if I keep up my vitamins and syrups, got some anti-inflammatories for the stiff neck, and a pat on the head.  Stress-wise, work is still chock-full of challenges, but something that wasn't working yesterday is today, so that's the start of something good.  And tomorrow IS Friday... a <a href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/daylightsaving.html">slightly long weekend</a>... enjoy it! :)</p>
