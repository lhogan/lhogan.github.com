    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.padre.ca/house/blog/">House</a>'s recent recap of his resolutions made me go back to <a href="http://www.lorihogan.com/2007/01/01/another-new-year-another-set-of-resolutions/">my own</a>... and I realize I'm not gettin' very far.  Here's my update...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I've been on and off the "healthy living" bandwagon since the start of the year, and as such I won't be making my 15lb. loss mark before heading to see <a href="http://www.geoffholden.com">Geoff </a>in <a href="http://www.frommers.com/destinations/sanfrancisco/">Northern California</a>.  But despite work and IEEE travel between now and then, I will get back on it and stick with it.  I've got a bridesmaid dress to look good for <a href="http://www.ourcelebrationsite.ca/25august2007/index.cfm">in August</a>, and other things to get in shape for...</p></li>
<li><p><em>sigh</em> I've been doing decently with keeping my extra-curricular activities organized, though I haven't kept it all to one night (I had designated Monday night as such).  But I need to do more to get on top of some of the bigger commitments, ie IEEE Canada.  Please, someone, nag me (not you House... I'm saving you for something else)... Randy?</p></li>
<li><p>Academics... huh?  What's dat?  Ya, I've done little/nothing in the past three months in this area.  I've wanted to, but I haven't put the energy into it.  And to be honest, I'm not gonna until at least after vacation.... but barring any extra work that comes up, I expect to be done my draft by the end of the year, and plan to use some of my four weeks annual leave to make that happen.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In other news, I spent the St. Patrick's Day weekend in Boston at an IEEE meeting.  The meetings went well, socializing was fun (though I did not drink any green beer... instead I had a seafood hangover).  The trip home was a bit of a pain - delayed out of Boston meant landing in Montreal when the plane to St. John's was supposedly taking off, rushed through customs and was told by the ticket lady (who wrangled us boarding passes after our flight had been "closed") to run run run all the way to the gate.  Little old out of shape Lori (see first bullet point) is in extreme debt to Rob, who ran ahead to let them know we were coming... only to find that the plane had just gotten to the gate.  Argh.  So we made the flight with plenty of time, though my luggage didn't, it came the next day.  Pics (of Boston, not of my luggage) to be posted soon.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's been busy lately.  The "start of fall" (which, yes, technically isn't until September 23 this year, but forever in my mind fall always starts once Labour Day has passed and school starts) always awakens a flurry of activity as we shake of the lazy hazy summer days.</p>

<p>Last weekend found me in Toronto hosting an IEEE workshop, this time for GOLD.  In my opinion and despite my best procrastination efforts, it went well, and I think most would agree.  I must definitely admit that I need some help in keeping track of time and keeping conversations on track.  And to learn that 5:00am is not the best time to do slides.  But... whatever.  No one got hurt.  The work's not over, not by a long shot.  But the pressure is less.</p>

<p>Work is interesting, though I sometimes feel isolated at my desk, programming and writing.  I like the company, like most of the people most of the time (there are always times when the best people get on your nerves, and there are some people who will always clash), and like the projects.</p>

<p>I leave it here for now.  Be good!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had an inkling of a plan.  I'm in Toronto heading a workshop on my birthday, and planned to maybe stay an extra night and see "Lord of the Rings".  Yes, I know critics panned it... but it did great at the Dora's.</p>

<p>Alas, its run stops September 3, about two weeks too early for me to catch it. :(</p>

<p>And B heads out to see "Avenue Q" tonight in NYC... <em>sigh</em> Yes, I've seen it.  Still doesn't mean I'm not envious.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Actually just said by a (former) celebrity Brandie Someone-or-Other in the Showcase Showdown of "The Price is Right" on "Gameshow Marathon", some sort of celebrity... well, gameshow marathon... "Is the trip by boat or by plane?".</p>

<p>The Showcase in question included a boat AND a trip to Sydney Australia.  Maybe she's one of three North Americans over the age of 20 who has never seen Bob Barker work his magic, and doesn't understand how the show works.  But dear Lord woman, I hope you aren't serious... a boat trip to Australia isn't a PRIZE, it's what the did to criminals a few hundred years back from England!</p>

<p>Generally speaking, it's funny to see people who probably haven't done their own grocery/furniture/anything shopping (well, paying for it) in years determine the cost of a couch or the Tums.  Thank god they have talent... or a good agent, or they'd be screwed.</p>

<p>Sorry... I'm kind of rambling.  As you were.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was at the airport last night, but for once it was not me who was going somewhere.  Brian is in Oslo, Norway for the next ten days for work... so back here, it's just me and the puppies!  It's kinda weird to not have someone else in the house, and to be honest i'm not sure what I should be doing!  I've cooked, cleaned, went to the gym, spent quality time with the dogs... there's not much left to watch on TV since the season finales are happening.</p>

<p>Any good, clean, useful suggestions?  Otherwise I'm gonna have to work on my thesis...</p>
