A sunny Sunday, 10a.m.
I'm letting the dog out to pee again
She comes back in, I make some toast
A bang on the house, could it be a ghost?</p>

<p>I peer out the curtains; no damage done
My eyes adjust to the blinding sun
I look to the ground, and there I see
The cause of commotion, a downed birdie</p>

<p>I can only assume you were out for a spin
Enjoying the autumn, catching the wind
Unable to see with your eyes with the glare
That it was our front window in front of you there</p>

<p>I'm sorry I couldn't do much more to aid
I went out to see you but you got afraid
You tried to escape but with the injuries sustained
You could not go far, now you're no longer pained</p>

<p>But you were a Flicker, red, black and brown
A beautiful woodpecker, even when down
I hope life was good for you, hope you had friends
Sorry about the accident, No hard feelings, the End</p>

<p>(A <a href="http://www.enature.com/fieldguides/detail.asp?recnum=BD0427">Northern Flicker</a> flew into our front window Sunday morning... I felt bad, but what's a girl to do?)</p>
