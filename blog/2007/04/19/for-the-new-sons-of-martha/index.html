<div class="entry-content"><p>Congrats to Brad, Randy, and all who I might have missed.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;The Sons of Martha&#8221;, by Rudyard Kipling</em></p>

<p>The Sons of Mary seldom bother, for they have inherited that good part;
But the Sons of Martha favour their Mother of the careful soul and  troubled heart.
And because she lost her temper once, and because she was rude to the  Lord her Guest,
Her Sons must wait upon Mary&#8217;s Sons, world without end, reprieve, or rest.</p>

<p>It is their care in all the ages to take the buffet and cushion the shock.
It is their care that the gear engages; it is their care that the  switches lock.
It is their care that the wheels run truly; it is their care to embark  and entrain,
Tally, transport, and deliver duly the Sons of Mary by land and main.</p>

<p>They say to mountains, &#8216;Be ye removed&#8217;. They say to the lesser floods,  &#8216;Be dry&#8217;.
Under their rods are the rocks reproved - they are not afraid of that  which is high.
Then do the hill-tops shake to the summit - then is the bed of the deep  laid bare,
That the Sons of Mary may overcome it, pleasantly sleeping and unaware.</p>

<p>They finger death at their gloves&#8217; end where they piece and repiece the  living wires.
He rears against the gates they tend: they feed him hungry behind their  fires.
Early at dawn, ere men see clear, they stumble into his terrible stall,
And hale him forth like a haltered steer, and goad and turn him till  evenfall.</p>

<p>To these from birth is Belief forbidden; from these till death is Relief  afar.
They are concerned with matter hidden - under the earthline their altars are;
The secret fountains to follow up, waters withdrawn to restore to the mouth,
And gather the floods as in a cup, and pour them again at a city drouth.</p>

<p>They do not preach that their God will rouse them a little before the  nuts work loose.
They do not teach that His Pity allows them to leave their work when they  damn-well choose.
As in the thronged and the lighted ways, so in the dark and the desert  they stand.
Wary and watchful all their days that their brethren&#8217;s days may be long  in the land.</p>

<p>Raise ye the stone or cleave the wood to make a path more fair or flat:
Lo, it is black already with blood some Son of Martha spilled for that:
Not as a ladder from earth to Heaven, not as a witness to any creed,
But simple service simply given to his own kind in their common need.</p>

<p>And the Sons of Mary smile and are blessed - they know the angels are on  their side.
They know in them is the Grace confessed, and for them are the Mercies  multiplied.
They sit at the Feet - they hear the Word - they see how truly the  Promise Runs:
They have cast their burden upon the Lord, and - the Lord He lays it on  Martha&#8217;s Sons.</p>
