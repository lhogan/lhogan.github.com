<div class="entry-content"><p>Some days (depending on if Brian needs to be dropped off, my mood and the traffic, etc.) I head out Blackmarsh Road to get to work instead of my usual Kenmount Road route.  Alojng that route there is a Catholic cemetery and church.  The other morning I went this way, and unconsciously caught myself &#8220;blessing myself&#8221; (making the Sign of the Cross) when passing the cemetery.  Caught me by surprise, since it&#8217;s something I haven&#8217;t really done since I was a child riding in the car with my parents (people who are regular church-goers, though I suspect it&#8217;s mainly for the jokes :) ).  The surprise led to a tad bit of guilt for not seeing my parents or going to church as often as I &#8220;should&#8221;&#8230;</p>

<p>I consider myself a practising Catholic (though granted perhaps I don&#8217;t practise often enough) and a generally good Christian, but one thing I definitely suffer from is a dose of good ol&#8217; Catholic Guilt, though not in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_guilt">the Wikipedia sense</a>, not consciencously.  And I think that leaves me predisposed to feeling guilt over a number of things, from not finishing my thesis yet to not seeing my family enough to not cleaning the house often enough to not being a &#8220;good wife&#8221; to not being more productive at work to not exercising more to not being assertive enough to being too assertive at times to not writing more letters or calling friends to&#8230; well, to a fairly endless list.  Surprisingly, I don&#8217;t worry all that much - I rarely lose sleep over these things, but then again I haven&#8217;t had a fully refreshing night of sleep in a long long time - but I think that&#8217;s more of a mechanism my mind has come up with so that I don&#8217;t end up in a frenzy or something, rather than me not actually worrying.</p>

<p>I came to the realization this morning that when I have deadlines and &#8220;things to do&#8221; (and I always have deadlines and &#8220;things to do&#8221;), I don&#8217;t get full enjoyment out of the good moments in life.  I managed to leave it all behind for our last vacation, but generally I can&#8217;t do that for a long weekend (or a normal weekend).  I think I&#8217;ve set up a condition/deal with myself that if I don&#8217;t have most things accomplished on my infinite list of &#8220;to-dos&#8221;, I can&#8217;t really have that much fun.  I don&#8217;t have to constantly worry about them, but I don&#8217;t get to anti-worry either.  I&#8217;m a perfectionist when it comes to certain things (I refuse to accept a less-than-perfect Duck Hunt score, and would reset the Nintendo if that happened), so maybe I&#8217;ve set my standards too high.  Maybe I&#8217;m always disappointed that I&#8217;m not &#8220;reaching my full potential&#8221;.</p>

<p>Why am I telling you all this, oh ye in internet land?  Maybe I&#8217;m talking to myself, and you&#8217;re listening in.  Maybe I think you all need to get to know me better.  Maybe I&#8217;m asking you to back the frig off when complaining I don&#8217;t blog often enough, because you&#8217;re making me feel guilty about THAT too.</p>

<p>I could be a good psychological study, yes?  Or a great drunk&#8230; but the emotional hangover would suck, another guilt line to add to the list. :)</p>
