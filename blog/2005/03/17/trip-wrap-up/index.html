<div class="entry-content"><p>Hi y&#8217;all.  When last we spoke, I told you all about travelling and my first day of meetings/fun.  The rest of the weekend went more-or-less to plan.  Saturday was 12 hrs of meetings, in which I tasked myself with a sub-committee of the two committees to examine SAC/GOLD relations and interface (sounds fun, doesn&#8217;t it?  I&#8217;m taking volunteers, if you are interested).  The somewhat productive day was marred by a &#8220;Devil&#8217;s Advocate&#8221; type who rather liked hearing his own voice, I suspect (it irks me when people do that).</p>

<p>Saturday night we went to a great &#8220;authentic Creole restaurant&#8221; called Cafe Sbisa.  Mmm&#8230;. Sbisa.  It was a lovely place (most of us were horribly under-dressed, but we had our own room so who cares?), with great wait staff and good food/swamp water (mmMmm&#8230; swamp water).  After that the group split.  My group saw some great blues in a hole-in-the-wall.  I think it&#8217;s the type of bar the locals wouldn&#8217;t be caught dead in, but the tourists don&#8217;t know any better.  We then proceeded to Bourbon Street, where we lost a man, Igor from Brazil.  As any &#8220;nice&#8221; group would do, we went to find him, but he was not to be found.  To make a long story short, after worrying and going back to the hotel early and waking several people, and then sleeping and getting up and worrying&#8230; Igor appeared.  His story?  He went to a bathroom, met up with some friends from high school, and went with them, assuming we wouldn&#8217;t worry.  Note to those of you who face this:  your friends WILL worry, at least a little.  If they don&#8217;t, then get new friends.</p>

<p>Sunday:  Started way too early and with Igor.  Half-day of meetings with motions and discussion.  Great news, grad student IEEE members - you get to vote in the upcoming election!  Yay us!  And the afternoon was ours.  We wandered for way too long to a restaurant that was way too full, so we went back in the old direction to find a place that could seat us.  Had some jambalaya - rice with yummy things.  Then I wandered by myself for a while (yes, Mom, I know - strange cities are not a good place for that.)  But I walked by the river in 27C weather (eat your hearts out) and sang &#8220;You are my Sunshine&#8221; with a street performer, rode a streetcar, bought some souvenirs, and didn&#8217;t get a sunburn (that&#8217;s kind of disappointing).</p>

<p>Note to travellers:  MAKE RESERVATIONS, OR EAT MCDONALDS.  The search for food resumed Sunday night.  No where was a seat to be found, until we hit a GREAT steak place.  Check out my Gallery, find the steak and cake.  Mmm&#8230; the pics still make my mouth water.</p>

<p>So&#8230; Monday was an early haul to the airport, where I found Fanta (which now sits in my fridge, to be combined with vodka some night soon)!  Nothing eventful flightwise to support - the flight gods must have read my earlier blog post and realized I had enough on the way down.  Was blessed by a Philipino woman in O&#8217;Hare after having a chat with her - I will now have tall babies.  I hope they aren&#8217;t tall at first, that could take a while in delivery.  Took in Lush in Toronto airport - gotta wonder how they get away with all the smelly stuff in a scent-free world such as ours.</p>

<p>And then&#8230; home.  Back to &#8220;my job&#8221;.  And snow. :( My countdown to summer is on.  Thanks for listening!</p>
