  <div class="entry-content"><p>Happy 2007!  As per tradition, here are the things I resolve to do/accomplish/achieve for this calendar year.  Many are leftover from last year&#8230; I&#8217;ll just keep chugging along on those ones I guess!  I&#8217;ve broken it into the goal and the plan.
<strong>What: </strong>Get in shape.
<strong>How:  </strong>Get to the gym for at least 30 minutes, at least three times a week.   Follow WW again.  Take puppies for a walk every day, weather-permitting.  Try not to let weather become an excuse.
<strong>What:</strong> Get back on track with my &#8220;extra-curricular&#8221; commitments&#8230; committee work and such.
<strong>How:</strong> Get all outstanding tasks done by mid-January.  Set aside one night a week (default will be Monday) at least to work on these things.  <em>Don&#8217;t freak out if work or family gets in the way. </em>Make it a goal to have tasks completed within two weeks of undertaking.
<strong>What: </strong>Continue my pusuit of academia, a.k.a. finish the thesis, for fall convocation if things go well.
<strong>How: </strong>Reacquaint myself with the research I&#8217;ve done to date, by end of January.  Then devote one afternoon each weekend to working on it.  Take some vacation time (four/five days) in February/March to work on it exclusively.  Have as much of a draft of thesis done before going on vacation in April.
Those are good for now, right?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was a crazy fall for work and work travel.  I found myself working hard in Naples for nearly a week, and on our day off myself and a co-worker took the quick train trek (about 45 minutes) to Pompeii.  If you have never watched the Discovery Channel or read anything historical, you may not know about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii">Pompeii</a> and the eruption of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Vesuvius">Mount Vesuvius</a> that buried it in AD 79.  If you live under a rock, you can be forgiven. :)</p>

<p>It was a great day for visiting the site in the fact that it was sunny and warm - 18 degrees Celsius on a November day ain&#8217;t not bad for a girl from Newfoundland.  We covered the ruined city the best we could in 5 hours or so, all on foot.  It was a large city, and from examining the ruins and following the audio guide you get a great feel for how the people of Pompeii lived.  The daily rythm of life was much like how we live - people worked (a lot of bakeries, farming, etc.), played (ampitheatres, brothels and such :)), ate (and ate out a lot, evident from the number of food &#8220;canteens&#8221; there seemed to be), drank, bathed (public baths, as per the Roman style), and enjoyed life.  And for many inhabitants, it all suddenly stopped as the city was buried in ash.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s very odd to be in a place you&#8217;ve heard so much about.  Even odder still to see the casts of the people frozen in time. Pompeii today is quite the tourist attraction, and to be honest was quite crowded and&#8230; well, &#8220;touristy&#8221;.  If I had a few more days in the area, I may have taken a different approach to things but c&#8217;est la vie.  At first, I wasn&#8217;t impressed, but as we kept walking, the magnitude of the city and the impact the eruption must have had on the local economy and lifestyle (even from those outside of Pompeii) became apparent.
I have posted pictures from Pompeii in my <a href="http://www.lorihogan.com/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=1822">gallery</a>, but unfortunately the thumbnails are not working.  Yo u are welcomed to scroll through the &#8220;full-sized&#8221; images.  I&#8217;ll work on the thumbnails.
This is Part 1 of two parts of my Pompeii review&#8230; the second is on Robert Harris&#8217; novel of the same name. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To all of you&#8230; sorry for not posting lately at all.  I&#8217;ll try to make up for it soon, promise!!</p>

<p>This is from <a href="http://www.myspace.com/neuroticaexotica">Nikki</a>&#8230; Love you babe!!</p>

<p>Here are the Rules: Each player of this game starts with the six weird things about you. People who get tagged need to write a blog of their own 6 weird things as well as state this rule clearly. In the end, you need to choose 6 people to be tagged and list their names. Dont forget to leave a comment that says you are tagged in their comments and tell them to read your blog.</p>

<p>SIX WAYS I&#8217;M WEIRD&#8230;.</p>

<ol>
<li>I&#8217;m posting this from the poker table, mainly to prove a point.</li>
<li>I count when I walk, in 4/4 time.</li>
<li>I like the smell of wet dog&#8230; I love my puppies.</li>
<li>I have the urge to sing when I hear the sound of scrapping ice off a car window&#8230; goes right through me, I need distraction.</li>
<li>I fear plumbing.  I have nightmares about overflowing toilets.</li>
<li>I sometimes lose focus in the middle of conversations (it&#8217;s either a hearing or mental problem, haven&#8217;t determined), so I have to catch up by pretending to understand.</li>
</ol>


<p>Rather than tag your comments, I&#8217;ll check to see who is paying attention here, who hasn&#8217;t given up on me:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m a casual reader of <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/">Scott Adam&#8217;s blog</a> (creator of <a href="http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/">Dilbert</a> for the non-devoted amongst you).  His views and writings vary from politics to tech to medicine, and generally he makes sense.  I think anyone who is having a crappy day needs to read <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/11/small_pleasures.html">his latest post on the small pleasures of life</a>.  It&#8217;s a bright spot in an otherwise dreary day&#8230; I am a single puppy parent for at least another week and a half, potentially longer.
Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow!!  I was having such a bad week with health and stress issues (save Tuesday&#8217;s night banquet, see below) and then my West Coast friend <a href="http://applpolisher.blogspot.com">Divinity </a>(through whom I&#8217;ve travelled vicariously quite a bit! :)) sends me these!  Not only are the flowers beautiful, but the vase is all stripey and perfect for any type of flower in the future (I may try some bamboo in my office in the near future).  I am very appreciative&#8230; thanks chick!  I&#8217;ll remember you (and your address) as I head out on some business trips in the next few months.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.lorihogan.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/diana_f.jpg" alt="diana_f.jpg" /></p>

<p>Earlier this week was <a href="http://www.oceansar2006.com">OceanSAR 2006</a>, a radar-for-ocean-technologies workshop for which I was web-master (or is it web-mistress?).  Anyhoo, at the workshop banquet at the <a href="http://www.fairmont.com/newfoundland/">Fairmont </a>Tuesday night (blackened halibut for main course, chocolate mousse cake for dessert&#8230; yummy), the organizing committee recognized the work of myself and a colleague who did FAR more than I in planning for this thing with a basket of flowers.  They did leak when I brought them back to the table, but luckily the tablecloth covered up my &#8220;mess&#8221;.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.lorihogan.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/conference_f.jpg" alt="conference_f.jpg" /></p>

<p>The health is improving.  I visited the <a href="http://www.mun.ca/student/health/">Student Health Centre</a> yesterday (and tried to ignore the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwalk_virus">Norwalk </a>buzz that filled the waiting room), got assurances that my cold will improve if I keep up my vitamins and syrups, got some anti-inflammatories for the stiff neck, and a pat on the head.  Stress-wise, work is still chock-full of challenges, but something that wasn&#8217;t working yesterday is today, so that&#8217;s the start of something good.  And tomorrow IS Friday&#8230; a <a href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/daylightsaving.html">slightly long weekend</a>&#8230; enjoy it! :)</p>
