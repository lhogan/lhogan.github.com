  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m a part of two Survivor pools this <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor12/">Survivor </a>season (the12th, in fact, season not pool I belong to).  One is with work, and I was randomly assigned <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor12/survivors/bio_sally.shtml">Sally</a>.  Whomever has the winner of Survivor, wins the pool.  Pretty simple - Sally hasn&#8217;t been voted off, therefore I&#8217;m sharing the lead with all those other people who&#8217;s pickees are still in it too.  On the other hand, the other pool is based on how well you score on a somewhat complicated survey created by <a href="http://www.earljw.com/">Earl</a>.  In that pool, I&#8217;m tied for last :( with Earl, I think.  Great minds think alike???</p>

<p>Who knows.  But I found it funny that this week, <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor12/survivors/bio_misty.shtml">Misty </a>was voted off the island.  Misty&#8217;s a cutie&#8230; I&#8217;m comfortable in my womanhood so I can admit it.  Normally &#8220;they&#8221; (aka the guys) keep the cute ones around, for entertainment and shoulder-rubbing and whatnot.  But more importantly to me, Misty is a electrical engineer.  And from what I read (I didn&#8217;t actually watch the show, but I&#8217;ll quote the website&#8230;),</p>

<p>The male alliance is in the driver&#8217;s seat, with Misty and Ruth Marie on the chopping block.  Terry is adamant that Misty should go&#8211;&#8220;She&#8217;s an engineer. She&#8217;s smart as hell, and she could cause some trouble&#8221;.</p>

<p>So, because she was an engineer and therefore smart (aren&#8217;t we all? :P), she was removed by the dominant male alliance.   I gotta wonder&#8230; if Misty were a man (hopefully not named Misty&#8230; that&#8217;s worse than naming a boy Sue) who was an engineer, and there was a female dominant alliance (which rarely happens), would they have voted Misty off?  Or if man Misty was not in with the male alliance, would man Misty still be around?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As per <a href="http://www.geoffholden.com">Geoff</a>, here are my own fun results from my <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Unfortunately+Lori%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N">&#8220;Unfortunately Lori&#8221; search</a> on <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Lori&#8217;s refusal to transfer has been wrongly interpreted as an unwillingness to return to the US when, in fact, it is an unwillingness to admit guilt and spend her life in a US prison when she knows she is innocent.</p>

<p><a href="http://ozten.com/random/killer_puppet_george_bush.jpg">Look at their president</a>, can ya blame me??</p>

<p>Unfortunately Lori&#8217;s hands and face are once more exhibiting the problems associated with the effect of the cold dry air.</p>

<p>Hey, that&#8217;s me&#8230; sorta&#8230; I&#8217;m a little scaly these days (though to be honest, the above quote comes from a site dedicated to freeing <a href="http://www.freelori.org/index.html">Lori Berenson</a>, who is being held as a terrorist in Peru though she and her family deny the charges&#8230; I add this info so my conscience is okay with this).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Lori passed away when her little girl was only four years old, so she didn&#8217;t get to walk her to school on the first day of kindergarten.</p>

<p><em>sniff</em>  I&#8217;m sad.  Well, I&#8217;m dead so technically I can&#8217;t really be sad.  Oh dear, this is getting depressing&#8230;.</p>

<p>unfortunately, lori&#8217;s werewolf tf has already started, and tommy and merton only have 5 minutes to till midnight, so, they try to stop the syndicate</p>

<p>Hmmm&#8230;. when&#8217;s the next full moon, hey?  And this is why I have a &#8220;hair issue&#8221;.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Lori&#8217;s plan backfires, and Casey is given a raise and promotion at LGT.</p>

<p>Damn that <a href="http://archives.cbc.ca/days_to_remember/classic_7988_en.asp?prov=1-111-1288">Casey</a>!  Never trust a puppet who lives in a tree house with his large puppet dog.</p>

<p>And finally&#8230;.
Unfortunately, Loris jet-setting big-city life isnt what she dreamed it would be.</p>

<p>Since I haven&#8217;t conquered world domination, I&#8217;ll have to agree with this one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I&#8217;m sitting on the couch, watching &#8220;The Biggest Loser&#8221; and munching on some snacks&#8230; that&#8217;s not right!  But I went to the gym earier and was relatively good w/ the whole WW thing, and I&#8217;m STILL being good with the WW thing because I&#8217;m eating Skinny Chips and drinking Diet Root Beer.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve updated my weight tracker&#8230;. see below.  And for those who asked, the &#8216;thing&#8217; is a bone, being chased by a dog (who has yet to come on screen).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most of the four people who read my blog know I&#8217;m trying to lose weight (I believe I mentioned it earlier).  My tool of choice, this time around as in last, is <a href="http://www.weightwatchers.ca">Weight Watchers</a>.  I figure it&#8217;s only fair to be honest with you, my fans.. er, I mean friends, and let you know how good (or bad) I&#8217;m doing in &#8220;real numbers&#8221;.  House (of The Madhouse) is doing it, so I guess I can do.  If nothing else, I&#8217;m adding someone else (or some 4 others) to whom I&#8217;m now accountable.  So see my cute little tracker, courtesy of a weight-loss-related blogging website I just found, extrapounds.com (clicking on the tracker will send you there).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.extrapounds.com/"><img src="http://www.extrapounds.com/tracker.bmp/3123.gif" alt="weight loss weblog" /></a></p>

<p>This is basically tracking from the start of the year, so right now I&#8217;m -6 lbs!!  I&#8217;ll keep it updated, promise.  Even if I don&#8217;t keep the &#8220;other&#8221; blog, I&#8217;ll let you know my weekly progress (weigh-in day is on Saturdays).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am easily distracted.  Now that I&#8217;ve joined the (supposed) productive working world, I find myself distracted by people talking around me.  To combat this, I bought some new headphones last night.  Ideally, I should have bought some high-tech active noice cancellation headphones, but I&#8217;m also vain&#8230; I don&#8217;t want giant earmuffs.  So I bought  <a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_DisplayProductInformation-Start?ProductSKU=MDREX51LP&amp;Dept=pa&amp;CategoryName=pa_Headphones_FontopiaEarbud">Sony Fontonia Earbud headphones</a> that go inside your ears.  I got the white ones because they were there, NOT because they match the iPod - in fact, I am trading Chris for his black ones.</p>

<p>I really like them.  Not only am I reducing the noise from fellow co-workers, the sound seems richer - I&#8217;m enjoying the extra bass.  I swear I can now tell the differenc ein bit rate in some songs in my collection.  Maybe that&#8217;s just in my head.  Much like ear plugs, I can use them without music to block out some extra ambient noise (and make it look like I&#8217;m listening to music).  But I am listening to music at a low volume, I want to keep my hearing. :)</p>

<p>Today, I am listening to <a href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora</a>.  It&#8217;s a &#8220;music discovery service&#8221; for those of us looking for something new.  You create a channel by telling it what bands/songs/etc. you like, and based on the &#8220;musical genome&#8221; of that info, it finds other things you may like.  It&#8217;s streaming, so the quality is decent but not beautiful (I&#8217;m okay with that).  You can pause, but can&#8217;t go back to a previous song.  So far it&#8217;s selection has been fairly kind to me, but you can give &#8220;thumbs down&#8221; to the things you don&#8217;t like (and &#8220;thumbs up&#8221; to those you do).  After feeding it some of my favourite artists like <a href="http://www.dmband.com/">Dave Matthews</a>, <a href="http://www.sarahharmer.com/">Sarah Harmer</a>, <a href="http://www.joshritter.com/">Josh Ritter</a> and <a href="http://www.sarahmclachlan.com/">Sarah McLachlan</a>, it&#8217;s given me some gems like <a href="http://www.benharper.net/">Ben Harper</a> and <a href="http://www.colinhay.com/">Colin Hay</a>, and a lot of live stuff from various artists (apparently it has decided I really like acoustic music, which I do).  I&#8217;d suggest you check it out!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yet another article indicates children of &#8220;analytically-minded parents&#8221; (engineers, scientists and such) have a higher chance of being diagnosed with autism, or have autistic tendencies.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4661402.stm">Scientific Brain Linked to Autism</a></p>

<p>Anyone who knows myself and B know that we&#8217;re not the most co-ordinated people (we&#8217;re &#8220;accident-prone&#8221;, to put it nicely), and to some degree with both suffer from skin problems (eczema, psoriasis, etc&#8230; B even has a skin scarring condition normally associated with African-Americans and those of South-East Asian descent).  We spent part of last night reviewing the medical history of the Kidney clan, and there are a few problems in there.</p>

<p>So, given genetics and luck, I&#8217;m fairly certain our kids will be born with glasses, flat feet, green skin and a &#8220;Kick-Me&#8221; sign.</p>

<p>But seriously, what&#8217;s wrong with being detail minded and lacking interest in social skills?  Now I must go finish the updated life-plan spreadsheet. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to the gym today and partook in a &#8220;step-and-ball&#8221; class.  Got a workout, greatly enjoyed it.  But now, 3 hours later, my abdominal muscles are like, &#8220;Hey!  We&#8217;ve spent quite some time hiding under that excess fat are your mid-section&#8230; we wanna stay hidden thanks very much!&#8221;  Thus I&#8217;m already stiff.  I can only imagine what tomorrow will be like&#8230;</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s a good day, including soreness (&#8220;it&#8217;s a good pain&#8221;, said the masochist).  I&#8217;m currently in school working on thesis/research work.  For those not aware, I am now a part-time student and full-time contract employee of C-Core (I am now a practising engineer!), so my Masters work has taken a backseat to work.  But I am actually enjoying doing this research today.  I think the step away from it is a good thing.  But I will finish within this winter semester - my goal is to finish the first draft before leaving for Australia on April 14th, leaving it with a bunch of loving friends who will edit it for me while I&#8217;m gone. :)</p>

<p>Speaking of goals, I&#8217;m back on the Weight Watchers wagon.  I know what some people may think (&#8220;It&#8217;s a cult!&#8221;) but you know what: it works.  I lost 40+ lbs last time I was OP (on program), and I can do it again, this time with the realization that it can come back.  So far, I&#8217;m three weeks in and 6 lbs lighter!</p>
