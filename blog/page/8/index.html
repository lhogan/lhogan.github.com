  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;re all aware by now that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation">everyone on earth is connected to anyone else to by five intermediary people</a>.  So, if you&#8217;ve got some time on your hands, try this&#8230;</p>

<p>Start with a link on your blog that leads to the website/blog of someone YOU KNOW&#8230; no celebs unless you could stop them at the supermarket and have a real chat with them.  That&#8217;s link #1.  From their page, select a link of someone (a) you do not already have linked on your page, preferably (b) that you don&#8217;t know and if possible (c) is someone THEY know (I know, I&#8217;m making this far too complicated).  That&#8217;s link #2.  And so it continues, until you get to link #6.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s both easier and harder than you&#8217;d think.  Some people don&#8217;t have links on their site to friends (does this mean they don&#8217;t have friends? Hmm&#8230;). Some people have the same links that I do.  And <a href="http://www.chriskidney.com">some people</a> haven&#8217;t updated in forever, thus I&#8217;ve discounted them.</p>

<p>I took the following path:
Link #1 - Me to <a href="http://www.earlwoodman.com/">Earl</a>
Link #2 - Earl to <a href="http://mind-boggles.blogspot.com/">Nancy</a>
Link #3 - Nancy to <a href="http://vickyth.wordpress.com/">Vicky</a>
Link #4 - Vicky to <a href="http://mumblingmonkey.blogspot.com/">Mumbling Monkey</a>
Link #5 - Monkey to <a href="http://pateys.nf.ca/weblog">Heather</a>
Link #6 - Heather to <a href="http://www.savemouse.com/wordpress/">Mouse</a>, a blogging whippet-like dog who has bad spelling but I&#8217;m sure means well, and now has a  CUNTINNUS DAG FIDIR!  He is happy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I took the idea from <a href="http://applpolisher.blogspot.com/2006/08/random-hitching-post.html">Div</a>, though I must thank her for not tagging me or anyone in particular.</p>

<p>So this game goes like this:
1. Go <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/random.php3">here</a>
2. Pick 5 quotes that &#8220;you think reflect who you are or what you believe&#8221;
3. Post them</p>

<p>Did I ever tell you about a nasty habit that flight attendants pick up on the job? We learn to always keep smiling, even when we&#8217;re out of Bloody Mary Mix. - Eric Wald, View From The Top, 2003</p>

<p>Believe it or not, I was once a smiley happy person.  Lately, not so much (as my sister-in-law points out every so often).  But I think (a) it&#8217;s not a bad thing to keep a positive outlook, and (b) it&#8217;s wrong to fake happy all the time - you&#8217;ve got to let people know your thoughts and emotions every once in a while&#8230; you&#8217;re not an island like Paul Simon.</p>

<p>Nothing is really work unless you would rather be doing something else. - James M. Barrie (1860 - 1937)</p>

<p>True.  Some days, the things that are work are the things I&#8217;m not getting paid to do.  Trying to stick more to things I enjoy nd stay away from the other stuff&#8230; but I&#8217;d always rather be sleeping.</p>

<p>My mother drew a distinction between achievement and success. She said that &#8216;achievement is the knowledge that you have studied and worked hard and done the best that is in you. Success is being praised by others, and that&#8217;s nice, too, but not as important or satisfying. Always aim for achievement and forget about success.&#8217; - Helen Hayes (1900 - 1993)</p>

<p>I really like this one.  Satisfaction and pride should come from within, not from what outsiders think!  I hope to achieve many things&#8230; but success can kiss my butt. :)</p>

<p>Do something. If it doesn&#8217;t work, do something else. No idea is too crazy. - Jim Hightower, The New York Times, March 9, 1986</p>

<p>Also know as &#8220;how to finish a Masters in Engineering&#8221;.</p>

<p>I have always found that mercy bears richer fruits than strict justice. - Abraham Lincoln (1809 - 1865)</p>

<p>If only more modern world leaders had the same thought&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dear stupid Kenmount Rd. drivers,</p>

<p>I know it was a Monday morning, and most of us aren&#8217;t totally awake on a Monday morning.  But for the love of God, <em>I</em> saw the large blinking arrow indicating that the left lane was closing in another hundred or so feet.  So did a lot of others.  But you keep on going like you&#8217;re oblivous to the blinking and then have the gall to butt in front of me!  I don&#8217;t appreciate it!</p>

<p>Ans I&#8217;ve reserved a special shame for the few who, after getting in the right lane as per common sense, decide to leave it to join the line-butters!!  Argh!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Signed,
More Awake Than You</p>

<hr />

<p>Dear International Astronomical Union,</p>

<p>Have a heart.  Pluto&#8217;s a great dog!  He&#8217;s Mickey&#8217;s friend!  He&#8217;s famous!  Just because he&#8217;s not a freak of intelligence like Goofy and evolved in one generation instead of a million, does not give you the right to put him &#8221;<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2006/TECH/space/08/14/planet.meeting.ap/index.html">on the chopping block</a>&#8221;.</p>

<p>Wait.  Just read the full story.  Change of plan.  You can&#8217;t take away Pluto&#8217;s planet status.  That&#8217;s really mean&#8230; you made a decision, you should have to stick with it! Plus, we&#8217;d have to make up a whole new rhyme to remember the planets&#8230; we need the Nine Pizzas that My Very Enthusiastic Mother Just Made Us.</p>

<p>Yours,
Confused and Hungry</p>

<hr />

<p>Dear Hallway Wall,</p>

<p>I&#8217;m onto you.  Just because you seem all solid does not mean you aren&#8217;t moving ever so slightly, getting in my way and making me seem clumsy when I bump into you. It&#8217;s assault,I tell you, and I won&#8217;t take it!</p>

<p>Signed,
Bruised but not Blind</p>

<hr />

<p>To whom it may concern:</p>

<p>If you use an apostrophe before the letter &#8216;s&#8217;, you better as hell be meaning ownership.  Because if you are trying to write a plural, you are wrong.  Wrong wrong wrong.  And you&#8217;ve pissed me off.</p>

<p>Your&#8217;s,
Me</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve admitted in the past to being a sort of grammar fanatic (you may not get that from my posts though).  I was thrilled by this Globe and Mail article today, <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060806.wr-rogers07/BNStory/Business/home">&#8216;A basic rule of punctation&#8217;</a>.  For those of you who can&#8217;t get the story or aren&#8217;t interested in reading it, it can be summed up in the next few sentences.  Rogers enteredinto a contract with Aliant to use their utility poles.  Due to the placing of a comma, the contract is not early as lucrative as Rogers&#8217; perceived it to be and will be out oodles of money.</p>

<p>I love it!  Not one big business cheating another by use of grammar (which is how sme see the whole thing), but rather I love that a simple comma can hold such an important place.  The clause of trouble is&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8220;The agreement shall continue in force for a period of five years from the date it is made, and thereafter for successive five year terms, unless and until terminated by one year prior notice in writing by either party.&#8221;</p>

<p>See, the combo of the two commas means that technically, the middle section (&#8220;and therefore&#8230; terms&#8221;) could be taken out of the sentence and it would not affect the overall meaning of the sentence - it&#8217;s just adding extra info.  So that means the sentence could read&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8220;The agreement shall continue in force for a period of five years from the date it is made unless and until terminated by one year prior notice in writing by either party.&#8221;</p>

<p>And that means Aliant has every right to do what they&#8217;re doing.  Rogers (or their lawyers) made the mistake of overlooking the second comma!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got this idea from reading a <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/factsandarguments">Globe and Mail piece today </a> (link may not work, I think it only points to the daily story).  You gotta admit it - you&#8217;ve done it to yourself, maybe when bored or to pass the time, or because others were doing it.  You&#8217;ve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_(verb">Googled </a>)yourself.</p>

<p>So, today I&#8217;m finding my dopplegoogles.  I don&#8217;t count the other Lori Hogan I know of locally (a relative of some sort, at the very least my first-cousin&#8217;s sister-in-law) because I didn&#8217;t find her web presence (though I know she&#8217;s gotten my internal mail before).  I&#8217;m pleased to see (at least through <a href="http://www.google.ca">google.ca</a>) I&#8217;m on the top.  I like it on top when I Google myself.  Among the list of dopplegoogles we have:
- <a href="http://www.afca.com/lev3.cfm/559">Administrative Assistannt to the American Footbal Coaches Association</a> - Too bad I don&#8217;t like football&#8230;
- <a href="http://www.jazznj.com/staff.php">Associate Jazzercise Instructor in New Jersey</a> - &#8230; and have no coordination &#8230;
- <a href="http://www.mooreschools.com/mhs/sports/athletic_staff_roster.htm">Head Coach of Girl&#8217;s Cross Country @ Moore High School</a> - &#8230; and can&#8217;t run
- <a href="http://www.wildlife-international.org/EN/public/birding/readaboutit.cfm">Bird Book Designer</a> - &#8230; but maybe I can do that, I like birds&#8230;
- <a href="http://members.jacksonholechamber.com/chamber/index.php?option=com_philaform&amp;form_id=2&amp;Itemid=1"> PR/Communications Manager of Jackson Hole </a> - &#8230; and can relate to the public!</p>
