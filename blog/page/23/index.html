  <div class="entry-content"><p>We made sure to drop by the Masonic Hall yesterday for the CD release of a friend and fellow O&#8217;D Patriot yesterday, Patrick Boyle.  <a href="http://www.brianscube.com"> Brian </a> and Pat go way back to kindergarten or something, but since birth Pat&#8217;s been into music in a huge way.  Since high school he&#8217;s done two degrees in music (bachelor&#8217;s in trumpet performance, master&#8217;s in ethnomusicology) and has performed in just about every type of group and every place imaginable (well, I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s been to space yet&#8230; but maybe).</p>

<p>His new (self-released) CD is entitled &#8220;Hold Out&#8221;, and with the exception of two tunes - a cover of &#8220;Always on My Mind&#8221; featuring everyone&#8217;s favorite Canadian Idol, <a href="http://www.jennygear.ca"> Jenny Gear</a> on vocals, and a performance of Thelonius Monk&#8217;s &#8220;Nutty&#8221; - all are composed arranged by Pat, and features him on trumpet and/or fluglehorn, with accompanying misc. percussion.  To my largely untrained ear, it&#8217;s good stuff - and I&#8217;m not just saying that because I know the guy.  The second track &#8220;Big R&#8221;, reminds me nothing of fish and chips but is still good.  I&#8217;d strongly suggest you check it out - you can borrow our copy to have a listen.  I&#8217;d definitely suggest you take a look at his website, <a href="http://www.patrickboyle.ca"> www.patrickboyle.ca </a>, it&#8217;s pretty cool (to my largely untrained eye) and has some samples of his work.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi y&#8217;all.  When last we spoke, I told you all about travelling and my first day of meetings/fun.  The rest of the weekend went more-or-less to plan.  Saturday was 12 hrs of meetings, in which I tasked myself with a sub-committee of the two committees to examine SAC/GOLD relations and interface (sounds fun, doesn&#8217;t it?  I&#8217;m taking volunteers, if you are interested).  The somewhat productive day was marred by a &#8220;Devil&#8217;s Advocate&#8221; type who rather liked hearing his own voice, I suspect (it irks me when people do that).</p>

<p>Saturday night we went to a great &#8220;authentic Creole restaurant&#8221; called Cafe Sbisa.  Mmm&#8230;. Sbisa.  It was a lovely place (most of us were horribly under-dressed, but we had our own room so who cares?), with great wait staff and good food/swamp water (mmMmm&#8230; swamp water).  After that the group split.  My group saw some great blues in a hole-in-the-wall.  I think it&#8217;s the type of bar the locals wouldn&#8217;t be caught dead in, but the tourists don&#8217;t know any better.  We then proceeded to Bourbon Street, where we lost a man, Igor from Brazil.  As any &#8220;nice&#8221; group would do, we went to find him, but he was not to be found.  To make a long story short, after worrying and going back to the hotel early and waking several people, and then sleeping and getting up and worrying&#8230; Igor appeared.  His story?  He went to a bathroom, met up with some friends from high school, and went with them, assuming we wouldn&#8217;t worry.  Note to those of you who face this:  your friends WILL worry, at least a little.  If they don&#8217;t, then get new friends.</p>

<p>Sunday:  Started way too early and with Igor.  Half-day of meetings with motions and discussion.  Great news, grad student IEEE members - you get to vote in the upcoming election!  Yay us!  And the afternoon was ours.  We wandered for way too long to a restaurant that was way too full, so we went back in the old direction to find a place that could seat us.  Had some jambalaya - rice with yummy things.  Then I wandered by myself for a while (yes, Mom, I know - strange cities are not a good place for that.)  But I walked by the river in 27C weather (eat your hearts out) and sang &#8220;You are my Sunshine&#8221; with a street performer, rode a streetcar, bought some souvenirs, and didn&#8217;t get a sunburn (that&#8217;s kind of disappointing).</p>

<p>Note to travellers:  MAKE RESERVATIONS, OR EAT MCDONALDS.  The search for food resumed Sunday night.  No where was a seat to be found, until we hit a GREAT steak place.  Check out my Gallery, find the steak and cake.  Mmm&#8230; the pics still make my mouth water.</p>

<p>So&#8230; Monday was an early haul to the airport, where I found Fanta (which now sits in my fridge, to be combined with vodka some night soon)!  Nothing eventful flightwise to support - the flight gods must have read my earlier blog post and realized I had enough on the way down.  Was blessed by a Philipino woman in O&#8217;Hare after having a chat with her - I will now have tall babies.  I hope they aren&#8217;t tall at first, that could take a while in delivery.  Took in Lush in Toronto airport - gotta wonder how they get away with all the smelly stuff in a scent-free world such as ours.</p>

<p>And then&#8230; home.  Back to &#8220;my job&#8221;.  And snow. :( My countdown to summer is on.  Thanks for listening!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here it is&#8230; bigger and badder than ever.  At least now I can say &#8220;I have a website/blog&#8221; and people ask &#8220;Where is it?&#8221;, I can get the answer out verbally rather than &#8220;well&#8230; let me write it down.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have not yet recapped my trip, BUT check out the photo gallery to the right.  Currently has New Orleans and Barcelona pics, but I&#8217;ll add more as time/space allows.  There <em>is</em> an RSS feed but I don&#8217;t have a link to it (you can already get it if you have Firefox).  But every post will contain the same love and caring as they did before.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am currently in New Orleans. The Big Easy. I figured out why they called it that. It&#8217;s the girls from Bourbon Street, some are big and most are easy. :) Not really.</p>

<p>But I digress. First I must talk about my trip to get here. Here&#8217;s a top five list of the bad things about my flight (and flying in general):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Food, or rather lack thereof. If one has been sitting on a plane for 1+ hrs, waiting for it to take off, and it&#8217;s lunchtime&#8230; well, one&#8217;s stomach start digesting itself. Would it KILL ya to pass the Yum Yum chips out early?</p></li>
<li><p>Planes, more specifically broken ones. What does &#8220;mechanical difficulty&#8221; mean exactly? I can take the general details. I&#8217;m a big girl.</p></li>
<li><p>Airports. Not the ones with free internet, those are good. I mean the ones where you have to run three miles (i.e. Chicago&#8230; it is pretty though) to get to the other terminal (and past the Cinnabon! Oh cruel fate). And the ones that Air Canada doesn&#8217;t employ people at (even though they do have flights that leave from there).</p></li>
<li><p>Airport employees (okay, this does contradict #3). The flight from Ottawa to Chicago was delayed more than once. At one point the board listed it as &#8220;Departed&#8221;. Did the staff ever get on the announcements to tell us ANYTHING? No. Not even the delay notices, you had to keep watching the board for that one. Did they try to check to see who had connectors? No. I got more info from the guy on the 1-888 # than I did from any live human. Argh.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>And in first place&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li>Boarding gates. They scare me. What if it broke off the building?  How would people get on the plane?  I used to think (when I was way little) it was a portal-type thing (although way-back, I would never had called it a portal) to another place (which in a sense it is, but I was thinking bigger things).</li>
</ol>


<p>But the flight had some good points. Met a cute puppy, a nice guy from Sudbury, and we had a band of merry men headed from Ottawa to New Orleans that stuck together, plus Hyungi, who we met in Chicago (she&#8217;s 9, plays Crazy 8s wrong). Did see a great art display in Chicago (hope to see it again and take a pic on the way back). And got Aeroplan points.</p>

<p>Today was good. Visited Cafe du Monde for beignets and cafe du lait. Listens to a man play trumpet on a corner. Touched a palm tree (!). Saw a girl flash someone for beads. Had an Original Hurricane and blackened alligator (tastes like chicken, different texture). Oh&#8230; and sat through 7 hrs of meetings (do you really want to know the details on those?).</p>

<p>Take care y&#8217;all. More if/when I get internet back.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m currently plugging away at my seal-counting or whatever it is I&#8217;m supposed to be doing&#8230; and realized I was not listening to anything (well, does eavesdropping count? :) ).  And I couldn&#8217;t really recall the last time I listened to music while I worked.  So on came my headphones and up came Windows Media Player (it serves its purpose, people).</p>

<p>For the fun of it, I selected &#8220;All Music&#8221;, a random hode-podge of all the songs I have collected from my collection (and a few songs from some other collections).  And I feel better for it.  I need music, but more importantly, I need variety.  In the car (I love you Brian) the choice is minimal. <a href="http://www.k-rock975.com"> Classic rock</a> is good, yes, but it gets old (pardon the pun).  And the other choices of radio station play&#8230; well, they don&#8217;t vary a whole lot.  Sometimes you can set your clock based on what&#8217;s on a particular station, or can actually switch from one station to another&#8230; where they&#8217;re playing the same song.</p>

<p>I need variety (though some would argue my collection really isn&#8217;t that varied).  I like to hear <a href="http://www.davematthews.com">Dave Matthews</a> sing sweet love songs to me (I do have a lot of Dave Matthews), followed by <a href="http://www.alanis.com">Alanis Morissette</a> ranting about men (that&#8217;s her earlier work - the later stuff is much more guy-friendly).  Throw in some <a href="http://www.sarahharmer.com">Sarah Harmer</a> with the vocals, guitar and clarinet (clarinet!!).  Add a dash of <a href="http://www.moist.ca">Moist</a>&#8217;s Silver. .. I even keep the <a href="http://www.vinceguaraldi.com/">Charlie Brown Christmas</a> tracks there (really, there just jazz).</p>

<p>Next ten songs: <a href="http://www.countingcrows.com">Counting Crows</a> - Murder of One,  Dave Matthews - Crash Into Me (how can you not love Dave Matthews?), <a href="http://www.mtv.com/bands/az/nirvana/artist.jhtml">Nirvana</a> - Man Who Sold the World, Alanis Morissette - That I Would Be Good, Dave Matthews - All Along the Watchtower, <a href="http://www.joshritter.com">Josh Ritter</a> - Kathleen (this guy opened for Sarah Harmer here in town, he&#8217;s great),  Counting Crows - Round Here, Moist - Underground, The Beatles - All You Need is Love, and finally <a href="http://www.bnlmusic.com">Barenaked Ladies</a> - If I Had $1,000,000.</p>

<p>I need some new music suggestions - groups, soloist, jazz, rock, country - I&#8217;m open to suggestion.  Got any?  <a href="mailto:lori.hogan@gmail.com">Email me</a>.  Or leave a comment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been busy&#8230; thus, no blog entries.  Though it makes one feel good when people let you know you haven&#8217;t been updating it.  This week is gonna be crazy - I&#8217;m heading for a RAB SAC meeting in New Orleans on Thursday morning.  What is RAB SAC, you ask?  It&#8217;s the committee I sit on for IEEE (well, one of several) as the Regional Student Representative for IEEE Canada (not that I like tooting my own horn, I didn&#8217;t get elected to the position or anything).</p>

<p>So, no good posts today.  Hopefully some better ones with pics after the weekend.  If you want me to pick you up some beads, write me an email and let me know.</p>
