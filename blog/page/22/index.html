  <div class="entry-content"><p>First off: politics.</p>

<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t pay attention, one Canadian scandal is currently erupting - the sponsorship scandal. Those Liberals paid one large sum of money for work that may or may not have been done to keep our fine country unified, and large sums of money from those who may or may not have been doing this work flowed back to the Liberals in the form of campaign and party contributions. That&#8217;s the general idea. There&#8217;s currently an inquiry, the Gomery inquiry, whose purpose is get to the bottom of it all. Since several witnesses face criminal trials for what may (or may not) have happened, a publication ban was/is in effect on what they were to say.</p>

<p>The ban was &#8220;blown&#8221; by an American (who does not fall under the ban, so it&#8217;s not really blown is it?), who published details - interesting, horribly unnerving details on what the government we elected may or may not have done, details that we mortal Canadians should not be able to read because of the ban. Now, I&#8217;d love to link his blog to my website, but according to his blog, some in Canada who HAVE linked his blog have received summons from the government. I don&#8217;t want that. But <a href="http://www.google.ca/">Google</a> &#8220;Captain&#8217;s Quarters&#8221; and/or &#8220;Captain Ed&#8221; and you should hit upon it. On a side note, it has some intersting commentary on world politics in general. Goodness, the people we elect&#8230; do they check their brains at the door of the Parliament building?</p>

<p>Onto religion:</p>

<p>Unless you yourself are under a total media ban, you are aware of the passing of Pope John Paul II. He was a great man who inspired many Catholics and non-Catholics to work together and be better people. I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with all the policies and beliefs he held up or implemented while the head of the Church, especially those policies dealing with women&#8217;s involvement in the Church and issues of birth control and disease control in developing and suffering nations. But he did more than other Pope to acknowledge other religions and faiths, and to take a step towards admitting faults of the Church in WWII. He will leave a big legacy to follow, and many anticipate what could come.</p>

<p><strong> Minor update </strong> Today (Friday) was the Pope&#8217;s funeral, a celebration of life and (dare I say it?)  Christian spirit attended by millions and likely watched by many millions more.  I only caught part near the end (the Litenany of the Saints, which nearly any half-practising Catholic could recognize in any language) and it made me a little sad (I didn&#8217;t cry, but I was sad) , and hopeful - like it&#8217;s been said on the news, this has provided a momentum for the RC church.  Let&#8217;s hope it keeps going somewhere.
<strong> End of update </strong></p>

<p>A few weeks back, (on my way to New Orleans) I read Dan Brown&#8217;s &#8221;<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671027360/qid=1112721831/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_0/701-9385827-6274706">Angels and Demons</a>&#8221;, having already read &#8221;<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385504209/qid=1112721853/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_3_2/701-9385827-6274706">The Da Vinci Code</a>&#8221;. It&#8217;s interesting timing compared to current events. Without giving too much away, the (ficticious) Pope in the novel has just passed away, so the process on how the next Pope is chosen is documented in detail. The book itself is a good read, but I thought it intersting how little I knew about some Catholic Policy, especially pertaining to the Vatican.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I went to the spaaaah, with Kerry, Connie, and Roma. The &#8220;Kidney girls&#8221;, sort of. <a href="http://www.monastery-spa.com/">The Spa at the Monastery</a> is a relaxing oasis in what was once a Catholic monastery (no, the priests did not get manicures and backrubs - it&#8217;s retrofitted). We took advantage of their &#8220;Vitality Level&#8221;, which has:
- mineral pool(kind of cool, kind of slimy, but apparently contains a bunch of good things for your skin)
- hot tub/whirlpool (ahhhh&#8230;. floaty hot goodness with jets on your back)
- steam room (just like the movies, it&#8217;s so good for opening the pores and so bad for trying to breathe)
- iceberg plunge (a small pool with freeezing water that&#8217;s supposedly good for firming, if you can stand it)
- sauna (heat)</p>

<p>It was good to take a break and just relax. After experiencing the Vitality level, I had my very first massage. Now THAT was good, though I&#8217;m a little sore right now. There are parts of my back that are thanking me for that massage. I&#8217;ll definitely get another one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An abbreviated version of the Weekly Movie Committee went to see the CG-animated movie &#8220;Robots&#8221; last night.  It has an all-star cast of voices, including Halle Berry, Ewan McGregor, Jim Broadbent, Drew Carrey, and my favorite, Robin Williams.  He shines through his character, Fender (hmm&#8230; Fender rhymes with Bender, the robot from Futurama).  The premise is nice and the message the movie delivers is a good one to remind kids of all ages.. &#8220;You can shine no matter what you are made of.&#8221;  It&#8217;s not the type of classic that most Pixar movies (or the Shrek franchise) have become, but it&#8217;s entertaining.  The animation is fair (nothing uber-cool or ground-breaking because it&#8217;s not a real scenario), and the &#8220;action&#8221; scenes are fun (two thumbs up for the Bigweld City transportation system).  If you are looking for something to see in theatres, go see it.  But it&#8217;s also fair to say you could wait for it to hit Blockbuster.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve added some random categories to the sidebar.  You can now see what I&#8217;m listening to and/or reading, in Random Songs and Readings. I&#8217;ll try to update those each time I update my blog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have now donated blood 19 times in my life.  I think that&#8217;s pretty good, especially considering the half-dozen or so times I tried to, but for various reasons got deferred.  I know there are some people who can&#8217;t give because of medical reasons or other restrictions, one person who refuses to give because of the (potentially) silly restrictions that <a href="http://www.bloodservices.ca/">Canadian Blood Services</a> has put in place, and a few more who are wimps, plain and simple (you know who you are).</p>

<p>Funny anecdote: I had no trouble with my donation today (they used the left arm though, that&#8217;s unusual), but beforehand I was sitting next to a &#8220;new donor&#8221;.  So I says, I does, in an attempt to comfort, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never had any troubles before, and this is my 19th time.&#8221;  Poor girl goes after me, and they can&#8217;t get the needle into her vein.  They instead nicked it, and she needed an ice pack and some (slightly more serious than normal) pressure.  I will never talk to anyone else again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve become one of THEM, those anti-social people with the white ear phones and groovin&#8217; step. On Thursday, my blue <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodmini/">iPod mini</a> came via Fedex. Kudos to Fedex for their awesome up-to-dateness on their website when it comes to shipping info - it&#8217;s accurate to within a half hour, unlike Canada Post who will tell you your stuff has been delivered three days later. I tracked my mini from China to Alaska to Memphis to Misassauga (Woody Allen - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0196216/">&#8220;I have always wanted to learn to spell &#8216;Connecticut&#8217;</a>&#8221;.  Lori Hogan - &#8220;Ditto, but for &#8216;Mississauga&#8217;&#8221;.) to here.</p>

<p>I like my new toy. It&#8217;s functional, but not over-bearing. I got the smaller (and cheaper) 4GB model - enough for ~900 or so songs. I certainly don&#8217;t need that much. It can serve to transfer stuff from one computer to another, as I get closer to thesis writing (I&#8217;d rather not actually talk about that right now though, if it&#8217;s okay with you; let&#8217;s just say I&#8217;m revving up to working my ass off, but worry I&#8217;m not smrt enough to find a viable solution&#8230; okay, bout of self-doubt over). It has my name and website (back to the iPod mini, not the thing were not talking about) engraved on the back, so if it wanders your way, you&#8217;ll know it&#8217;s mine, please send it home. I&#8217;m currently listening to Dave Matthews (surprise?) but who knows what Shuffle will bring?</p>

<p>Anyhoo, enough about &#8220;Blue Devil&#8221; (that&#8217;s her name, since she&#8217;s blue, get it?). This weekend was the most important feast in the Christian year - did you go to church? (Sorry, channeling my grandma). No, Easter was a good time for me. I went &#8220;around the bay&#8221;, to the home of my ancestors. Many Newfoundlanders have different &#8220;around the bay&#8221;s but mine is in Conception Bay. My grandma (the one I channeled - you can channel the living right?) and many aunts and uncles reside there. Not many cousins left there, because economically, there&#8217;s not much happening. But the scenery is beautiful, once you learn to block out the rusting cars and abandoned houses that are becoming too common. I did go to church, and spent a lot of time playing cards (that&#8217;s actually a hazardous past time, watch out for flying cards), and talking to my grandma. She&#8217;s a good woman (some may disagree but we&#8217;ve always gotten along), but lately age and circumstances have not been kind to her. It was nice to talk and play cards with her, and I hope to get the chance to do it again soon.</p>

<p>We whisked from around the bay to &#8220;town&#8221; to eat some turkey and enjoy some chocolate and &#8220;discussion&#8221; at the Kidney house. That was as fun as always&#8230; though sometimes loud, it&#8217;s always entertaining.</p>

<p>Oh - shout out to my cousin Danielle.  She&#8217;s 12, and is pretty kewl.  This is her:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The title may seem to contain two unrelated terms, but they are indeed linked, as they were two unusual (i.e. not everyday things, NOT that they are weird things to do) things I did today.</p>

<p>The first was my semi-annual trip to my dentist.  I do like my dentist, though I must admit that dentists in general freak me out.  Who would elect to go into the profession of looking into people&#8217;s mouths, except for huge sums of money?  Dentists must have a sadistic streak in them.  Take a look at the instruments - would a pacifist create such tools as the hook thing, the scraper, the poky thing and the mirror (those are not the technical names)? And all the fuctions performed by the above tools, though healthy, does cause pain, and in some cases bleeding.  A little sadistic, no?  All that to find a small cavity and get a toothbrush.</p>

<p>My good friend Nikki is coordinating/organizing the annual Festival of Modern Dance.  They had an event tonight, called &#8220;First Look&#8221;.  It was a chance for performers to try out some new materials.  Well, it was all new to me - it was my first exposure to the &#8220;modern&#8221; genre.  And I liked it - I think.  The first piece started with the performer covered in rocks, lying on the floor (I think it was about how nature is being destroyed, that&#8217;s what the accompanying soundtrack suggested).  I&#8217;ll be honest - the first piece baffled me.  The second piece was less &#8220;out there&#8221; to me - improvisational modern dance based on colours from a changing light and words suggested by members of the audience.  The effort of the performer was visible and audible, as there was no background music and you could hear her work, see her sweat.  How she reacted to the colour and associated word was really interesting.</p>

<p>The last piece was&#8230; odd.  I <em>think</em> it explored exploitation of women.  A very large-breasted women was the &#8220;star&#8221;, and in the first part she was getting her hair ready; the second part men came and took pictures of her chest (her bra was &#8220;modified&#8221; to expose the &#8230; sensitive areas); the third part froze the men and brought forth in dance and signs the emotions she and other women exploited by men; the final part brought back the men .  It was .. interesting.  &#8220;Got it&#8221; more than the firstpiece but barely so.</p>

<p>Is modern dance my thing?  I dont think so, but I do want to see more before making final judgement.  I&#8217;ll keep you posted.</p>
