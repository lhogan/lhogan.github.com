  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Monday, I saw the movie &#8221;<a href="http://www.mgm.com/ua/hotelrwanda/intro.html">Hotel Rwanda</a>&#8221;, which looks at the story of one hotel manager who saved over 1200 Hutu and Tutsi refugees in 1994, when genocide was taking place in <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/rw.html">Rwanda</a> and no one else in the world would help stop it. The movie is not very violent (I saw worse when I flashed past last night&#8217;s &#8221;<a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/ncis/index.shtml">NCIS</a>&#8221; episode), and had a PG rating. But there was no need for blood and gore to tell this story - instead it is told through the sound of gunfire and the threat of militia driving by. It is told by the disappearance of loved ones, the loss of basic freedoms, and the fear of death you see in people&#8217;s eyes. It is a very powerful movie, and is made more so because it avoids the obvious violence that could have been shown.</p>

<p>Last night was the season finale of &#8221;<a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/amazing_race6/">The Amazing Race 6</a>&#8221;. It has been my &#8220;guilty pleasure&#8221; of television watching (I know, I know - there have been seasons before this one, I just never got around to watching them). While my favorite team of Kris and Jon did not win (they came second), it was good to see them happy (even if it was acting) at the end. I can&#8217;t help but wonder if the get the airline points for all that travel. New season starts in three weeks - and Rob and Ambuh from a former <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor10/">Survivor</a> (which Survivor? I don&#8217;t know, I lost count at 22) are on it - yay, another <a href="http://www.warhol.org/contest/contest.asp">15 minutes</a> for them!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, I have fallen into the same routine. Every weekend (say, Friday evening) I lay out in my head the plan of all the good things I will do over the weekend, like clean and file and research.</p>

<p>What ends up happening? Of my list of ten things, I get 1.75 done. And by the time Sunday night rolls around, I say &#8220;Blah, why can&#8217;t I be more productive?&#8221; It&#8217;s pathetic. Am I lazy? Probably, though I&#8217;m not inclined to admit it. I&#8217;m more inclined to blame it on someting I can&#8217;t control, maybe it&#8217;s Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. In any case, I&#8217;m going to start exercising more (yes, I know that was one of my New Year&#8217;s Resolutions).</p>

<p>Did go to &#8220;For the Love of Beagles&#8221;, and it was fun. Highlights? Kerry&#8217;s battle with the guy from the bar to own Louis. Tiug&#8217;s painting, the proceeds from which will pay for his eye surgery. And oh yes, the chocolate&#8230;mmmm&#8230;..</p>

<p>Okay, so I alluded to my New Year&#8217;s Resolutions earlier. I&#8217;m still &#8220;sticking&#8221; to them in a general sense. But I need to be more specific, so I have weekly goals, and they are:
- go to the gym on Tuesday and Thursday
- finish folding laundry and vacuuming upstairs/downstairs
- collect more research data from the stuff on my desk (okay, so thi one you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about&#8230; but I do)</p>

<p>Ciao.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>No ranting for me today, too tired.  Got Barney to the airport today for 7am, only to wait in the cold for 30 minutes until someone with WestJet cargo came by.  But it was good to see him off - I know he&#8217;s gonna be fine.  Just for an instant, I thought I&#8217;d cry.  But I didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the Love of Beagles&#8221; Silent Auction and Chocolate Buffet is on Sunday night!  Go!</p>

<p>Saw &#8220;Sideways&#8221; on Monday night.  Good movie.  I liked Paul Giamatti, a very good job at playing a quasi-loser.  I felt for him.  And the extra wine info was neat.  If I only had the money&#8230;.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it for now.  I&#8217;m gonna stay awake a little longer and then go home.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week, the movie committee elected to see In Good Company with Dennis Quaid and Topher Grace, Scarlett Johansson and Marg Helgenberger.  And it was very good!  It&#8217;s sweet and funny, fairly good acting and Topher is dreamy&#8230;.. :).  The acting was good (well, there were some cheesy moments, but they were well-acted), there were some very funny parts (note:  you will see Dennis Quaid&#8217;s behind), and the ending was not totally predictable, as is the norm in a lot of &#8220;sweet and funny&#8221; movies.</p>

<p>We have a foster-beagle this week, Barney, a beagle-coloured dog who is a bit too big to be called a beagle.  But he looks like one from far away!  Barney&#8217;s going to live in Alberta, as soon as he can find a flight out.  He and April get along well, though they fight a bit.  They unite to bark at neighbourhood skeets, as seen in the random shot to the right.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes, people should really think before they say something.  Such is the case of Lawrence Summers, president of Harvard(!).  Check out the CBC version of the story <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/story/science/national/2005/01/18/harvard-president050118.html">here</a>:</p>

<p>Basically, to a workshop of selected scholars on how to diversify math and sciences, he suggested there are &#8220;innate differences&#8221; (from men, I presume) that prevent women from succeeding in math and science.  For a smart man, he made several mistakes.</p>

<p>Mistake #1 - Watch your audience, buddy!  He was talking to a group who have been invited to basically talk about how to include societal groups those not already involved in science and math.  Let&#8217;s not get rid of a rather large group of possibility.</p>

<p>Mistake #2 - Get the message right!  Believe it or not, he may be right in saying this should be better studied - I&#8217;ve always been curious on the reasons why there are less women in science and math, and who knows if maybe there are typical traits in one sex that makes math and science more interesting (I lump engineering in here too, by the way).  But that would only explain why women don&#8217;t ENTER these fields, certainly not why those who brave the sometimes cold climate to follw a dream, don&#8217;t seem to achieve as much as male counterparts.  And most women who go for it DO succeed!</p>

<p>Mistake #3 - Even if the audience was a little different, or the message changed a bit, the president of one of the world&#8217;s best universities should not make such statements that relate to half the world&#8217;s population, without first doing a little research of his own to back such claims.  How his daughter named her trucks doesn&#8217;t count (that&#8217;s in another story on the same topic, see <a href="http://www.local6.com/education/4090001/detail.html"> here </a>).</p>

<p>MAYBE the reason why some women don&#8217;t succeed in non-traditional fields is because the &#8220;traditional&#8221; folk still see those fields as &#8220;their&#8221; domain.  Maybe it&#8217;s such comments that differences exist in academic ability of men and women that turn off women from being successful - if they say this when you fail, what will they say when you do better?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ll fully admit that I am not an art critic, nor do I really know a lot about art.  Reading a story on CBC&#8217;s website about <a href="http://www.marlaolmstead.com/">Marla Olmstead</a>, a 4-year-old New Yorker, makes me wonder - do people who buy art like this really have too much money to spend?  Looking at her online &#8220;gallery&#8221; some of them are very pretty&#8230; but do they mean anything to her, or was she just having fun and getting dirty?  I&#8217;ll admit though, that I&#8217;ll buy this as &#8220;good&#8221; art before I do the things created by turtles, monkeys or dogs, all of whom I&#8217;ve seen stories recently about.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was in high school, I was a morning person.  I would happily get up at 7am all during the week, and even on Saturdays for my extra-curricular activities.  No sweat getting by on 5-6 hours sleep.  It was enough.</p>

<p>What happened?  I&#8217;ve now been reduced to a crank who can&#8217;t function without 8+ hours of sleep, and someone who can&#8217;t tolerate getting up before 8am.  I think it&#8217;s the result of first-year university, where I had to face those horrible steps leading from the tunnel to the TSC (the old one, yes, I feel old).  Whatever energy I had woken up with was gone by the time I hit the top of those stairs.  So eventually, I think my body adapted and decided not to provide me with any morning energy, if I was just going to waste it first thing.</p>

<p>My reluctance to waking is partly because of my &#8220;new&#8221; sleeping partner.  When I was single and slept alone, I would wake to my radio alarm clock and get up when the alarm went off.  My husband, bless his cotton socks, can&#8217;t possibly do that.  The radio won&#8217;t wake him, and getting up without at least one snooze session will physically hurt him.  So I&#8217;ve tried changing, but I&#8217;ve got to admit that the &#8220;alarm&#8221; mode sounds freakishly like a fire alarm, not a wake-up call.</p>

<p>We have a new routine that involves getting up earlier now.  Last week it was bearable, but only just so, and last week was a short week.  I&#8217;ll let you know how it is by Friday.</p>

<p>GOOD NEWS:  I&#8217;ve been keeping to my resolutions.  Been to the gym twice last week (I&#8217;ll go again this week too), been eating healthier, spent time with friends n Saturday night (thus resulting in a new resolution:  Don&#8217;t drink so much lush!).  Haven&#8217;t been extremely rude to my mother (it&#8217;s a start).  Still working on the &#8220;time for work/other things&#8221; one&#8230; but I haven&#8217;t regressed to laying Bounce Out during the day.  Though I was introduced to MSN Games this weekend (thanks Kerry)&#8230;..</p>
