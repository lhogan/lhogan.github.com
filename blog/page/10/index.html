  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some days (depending on if Brian needs to be dropped off, my mood and the traffic, etc.) I head out Blackmarsh Road to get to work instead of my usual Kenmount Road route.  Alojng that route there is a Catholic cemetery and church.  The other morning I went this way, and unconsciously caught myself &#8220;blessing myself&#8221; (making the Sign of the Cross) when passing the cemetery.  Caught me by surprise, since it&#8217;s something I haven&#8217;t really done since I was a child riding in the car with my parents (people who are regular church-goers, though I suspect it&#8217;s mainly for the jokes :) ).  The surprise led to a tad bit of guilt for not seeing my parents or going to church as often as I &#8220;should&#8221;&#8230;</p>

<p>I consider myself a practising Catholic (though granted perhaps I don&#8217;t practise often enough) and a generally good Christian, but one thing I definitely suffer from is a dose of good ol&#8217; Catholic Guilt, though not in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_guilt">the Wikipedia sense</a>, not consciencously.  And I think that leaves me predisposed to feeling guilt over a number of things, from not finishing my thesis yet to not seeing my family enough to not cleaning the house often enough to not being a &#8220;good wife&#8221; to not being more productive at work to not exercising more to not being assertive enough to being too assertive at times to not writing more letters or calling friends to&#8230; well, to a fairly endless list.  Surprisingly, I don&#8217;t worry all that much - I rarely lose sleep over these things, but then again I haven&#8217;t had a fully refreshing night of sleep in a long long time - but I think that&#8217;s more of a mechanism my mind has come up with so that I don&#8217;t end up in a frenzy or something, rather than me not actually worrying.</p>

<p>I came to the realization this morning that when I have deadlines and &#8220;things to do&#8221; (and I always have deadlines and &#8220;things to do&#8221;), I don&#8217;t get full enjoyment out of the good moments in life.  I managed to leave it all behind for our last vacation, but generally I can&#8217;t do that for a long weekend (or a normal weekend).  I think I&#8217;ve set up a condition/deal with myself that if I don&#8217;t have most things accomplished on my infinite list of &#8220;to-dos&#8221;, I can&#8217;t really have that much fun.  I don&#8217;t have to constantly worry about them, but I don&#8217;t get to anti-worry either.  I&#8217;m a perfectionist when it comes to certain things (I refuse to accept a less-than-perfect Duck Hunt score, and would reset the Nintendo if that happened), so maybe I&#8217;ve set my standards too high.  Maybe I&#8217;m always disappointed that I&#8217;m not &#8220;reaching my full potential&#8221;.</p>

<p>Why am I telling you all this, oh ye in internet land?  Maybe I&#8217;m talking to myself, and you&#8217;re listening in.  Maybe I think you all need to get to know me better.  Maybe I&#8217;m asking you to back the frig off when complaining I don&#8217;t blog often enough, because you&#8217;re making me feel guilty about THAT too.</p>

<p>I could be a good psychological study, yes?  Or a great drunk&#8230; but the emotional hangover would suck, another guilt line to add to the list. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Note:  Despite it being Monday, I&#8217;m in a generally good mood&#8230; so don&#8217;t take this post as some sort of depressive negativity overwhelmed rant&#8230;)</p>

<p>I, like a lot of other people, wish I had more free time.  But, at the very least until I finsh my thesis (let&#8217;s not go there, shall we?) and get past September&#8217;s IEEE GOLD Congress, and knock off a few more &#8220;To-Dos&#8221; from my list, I probably won&#8217;t.  But when I do get the time, there a number of things I&#8217;d like to do.  I know a lot of them, reasonably won&#8217;t happen until I retire or something, unless I end up in a body-cast for some reason&#8230; but feel free to suggest other things!</p>

<ul>
<li>Learn to run without feeling like an idiot</li>
<li>Watch all episodes, marathon-style, of &#8220;Scrubs&#8221;, &#8220;Farscape&#8221;, and &#8220;Sex and the City&#8221;</li>
<li>Re-read &#8220;The Lord of the Rings&#8221; and &#8220;Harry Potter&#8221; books</li>
<li>Read the books that I&#8217;ve bought but haven&#8217;t read yet</li>
<li>Take the dogs on a long car ride followed by a good hike</li>
<li>Camp more</li>
<li>Learn to golf (or at least hit a golf bal somewhat consistently in a predicted direction farther than five feet)</li>
<li>Learn to use the fancy-pants camera we have, more than just the pre-defined settings</li>
<li>Walk around St. John&#8217;s and Mount Pearl and actually take pictures without feeling like an idiot or a tourist</li>
<li>Take a conversational French course</li>
<li>Drive to Gros Morne National Park and spend a week without contact</li>
<li>Visit family I haven&#8217;t seen in a while</li>
<li>Work on my family tree</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Actually just said by a (former) celebrity Brandie Someone-or-Other in the Showcase Showdown of &#8220;The Price is Right&#8221; on &#8220;Gameshow Marathon&#8221;, some sort of celebrity&#8230; well, gameshow marathon&#8230; &#8220;Is the trip by boat or by plane?&#8221;.</p>

<p>The Showcase in question included a boat AND a trip to Sydney Australia.  Maybe she&#8217;s one of three North Americans over the age of 20 who has never seen Bob Barker work his magic, and doesn&#8217;t understand how the show works.  But dear Lord woman, I hope you aren&#8217;t serious&#8230; a boat trip to Australia isn&#8217;t a PRIZE, it&#8217;s what the did to criminals a few hundred years back from England!</p>

<p>Generally speaking, it&#8217;s funny to see people who probably haven&#8217;t done their own grocery/furniture/anything shopping (well, paying for it) in years determine the cost of a couch or the Tums.  Thank god they have talent&#8230; or a good agent, or they&#8217;d be screwed.</p>

<p>Sorry&#8230; I&#8217;m kind of rambling.  As you were.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was at the airport last night, but for once it was not me who was going somewhere.  Brian is in Oslo, Norway for the next ten days for work&#8230; so back here, it&#8217;s just me and the puppies!  It&#8217;s kinda weird to not have someone else in the house, and to be honest i&#8217;m not sure what I should be doing!  I&#8217;ve cooked, cleaned, went to the gym, spent quality time with the dogs&#8230; there&#8217;s not much left to watch on TV since the season finales are happening.</p>

<p>Any good, clean, useful suggestions?  Otherwise I&#8217;m gonna have to work on my thesis&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I thought this article, <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0515/p13s01-stct.html">It&#8217;s All About Me</a>, was interesting, especially since I&#8217;ve been misunderstood recently, not in email, but in message boards and blogs I regularly comment on&#8230; and well, my own blog too.  As stated in the article,</p>

<blockquote><p>First and foremost, e-mail lacks cues like facial expression
and tone of voice. That makes it difficult for recipients to
decode meaning well.</p></blockquote>

<p>Which is why every email, blog posting and message board posting should be accompanied by a face shot&#8230; preferably of the poster, but if one isn&#8217;t available you can use a substitute.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Realized I never finished the Australia story off.  But we were at the airport, so it&#8217;s not much longer now.  The only real &#8220;eventful&#8221; part of the flight home was the stop in Honolulu.  As per the previous trip, we had to deplane (is &#8220;plane&#8221; a verb too?).  But since there wasn&#8217;t a US Customs to go through in Sydney, we had to do this in Honolulu, with everyone else from the plane, pretty much at the same time.  Long line, late night (well, out-of-whack body clock for sure), very cranky.  Get our passports stamped (I was here?).  Head down a stairway, outside arrivals to get to a fire exit door (with signs directing us to go this way&#8230; otherwise I&#8217;d think it was shady) to go up stairs to get to security.  Yes, then we got to go through Security&#8230; and it&#8217;s Americans running it, so you practically need to get naked before heading through the metal detector.  Put pants back on, shoes back on, gather belongings and&#8230; wait.  In an airport with absolutely nothing open&#8230; despite the fact that flights are indeed coming and going, and there is a dollar to be made, and dammit it&#8217;s hot in an open-air airport, I could use a Frappucinno!  So instead of that, I sit next to the gate and make chit-chat with strangers (I hate making chit-chat with strangers, BTW&#8230; I may start breaking out in hives next time I do it).  Then we board, and off to Vancouver, where we arrive&#8230; at the exact same time and date that we departed Sydney, 17 hrs earlier.  Silly international dateline.</p>

<p>The couple of hours to kill in Vancouver pass quickly, as do the few in Toronto (yay Lush!) and then&#8230; home. :)</p>

<p>And since then, I&#8217;ve been playing catch-up, and planning life, and determing when the hell I&#8217;m going to do everything.  It&#8217;ll get done.  But if you see me half-asleep with my eyes closed, don&#8217;t wake me - I may be back on the Reef with the Nemo fish.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You&#8217;ll be thrilled to know that things at the IEEE meeting I was not attending turned out marvellously.  Sometimes other people simply rock! And sometimes things work out.</p>

<p>Anyhoo, let&#8217;s go back to the Sydney airport, just after I bought my Swatch.  We toddled on over to our gate, but it was blocked off.  Odd.  Just to the left of the gate, a security guard stood, looking out the window.  And that&#8217;s when we noticed what was happening outside.  An Australian soldier in Iraq was killed, and the morgue originally returned the wrong body to Australia, mixing him up with the body of a Kuwaiti worker.  What we were witnessing was the actual return of the    Private Jake Kovco, 25, to his unit in Sydney.  After autopsy (the circumstances surrounding his death - he died from his own gun - are a little mysterious), his body was to be returned to his hometown near Melbourne.  It was very somber to witness the procession, led by a religous official, casket carried by members of the unit while the rest stood at attention in two rows on either side.  To see the soldier&#8217;s mother being led to a car (Pvt. Kovco also had a wife and two young children, but they may have been hidden from our view) was heart-breaking.  We hear of deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan, and sometimes the names and numbers and causes blur together in our world of insta-news.  But this was perfectly clear.  And cause for reflection, on life and death and war.</p>

<p>I think I&#8217;m going to leave this at here for now.  Im uploading pics as I type&#8230; they should be there soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sooo&#8230; somewhere between last week and now I miraculously returned hme and resumed life, which is a little crazy as I scramble to prepare for an IEEE meeting I&#8217;m not actually attending.  Why, oh why do I choose to do things?  Why couldn&#8217;t I spend Friday night drinking or bowling like a normal mid-twenties-year-old ?</p>

<p>Let me fill you in on the rest of our trip.  Our second-to-last full day in Sydney we went to Taronga Zoo.  I&#8217;m a big zoo fan, and this was a good zoo to be sure.  The easiest way to get there is to take a ferry from Circular Quay - that brings you to the &#8220;back door&#8221; of the Zoo.  To get to the &#8220;front door&#8221; you take a gondola over the entire zoo.  Quite the view.</p>

<p>A highlight of the zoo was the Seal show&#8230; they have several trained seals who &#8220;perform&#8221; while the narrator explains quite a deal aabout the seals and their training.  Another highlight was the dingo&#8230; however, it was not eating any babies while we were there.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lorihogan.com/uploaded_images/100_1940-724739.JPG"><img src="http://www.lorihogan.com/uploaded_images/100_1940-718071.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>After the zoo we hit the Hard Rock Cafe again in an attempt to get a shot glass&#8230; no joy with the shotglass :( but some with the giant sundae we shared. :)  Then we headed back to the hostel to finish off our wine and pre-pack some stuff.</p>

<p>Our original plan for our last day in Sydney  was to head to the Blue Mountains, but we really wanted to just hang out in Sydney and thus, that&#8217;s what we did.  We went back to Paddy&#8217;s Market to pick up some souvenirs and then we took the subway to Sydney Olympic Park, home of the 2000 Summer Olympics.  A beautiful spot, with nice walking trails, public art, large open spaces and tons of pregnant women and children.  The reason for the women and children was a Pregnancy and Children Expo being held out there (and surprisingly, not because of the Korn concert that was held the night before).  But we spent several hours walking around, checking out the different sport facilities and attractions.  One of the most popular attraction we saw was McDonald&#8217;s&#8230; it was packed!  And, well, we were hungry. :S  And that was basically it for our last full day in Sydney.</p>

<p>The next day, our travel day, started quite early as we had previously booked a 6am shuttle to the airport, with the transportation branch of the Russian Mafia.  We first encountered these fine folks when we were trying to catch another shuttle after arriving from Cairns.  We were assured that the one we were looking for and the unmarked shuttle van they weretrying to get us to buy tickets for were ultimately the same thing.  Okay, whatever, the price was the same and they were there NOW, so we bought return tickets to save a few bucks when returning home in a few days.  I was told to call 24 hrs in advance to book the return trip.</p>

<p>The first hint that the companies weren&#8217;t the same was when I tried calling the numbers on my return ticket.  There were three - two printed on the ticket and one the seller hastily wrote when he passed the tickets.  When I first called the written number, there was no answer&#8230; no problem, I tried the first printed number&#8230; no answer.  Okay, it&#8217;s early.  Maybe they aren&#8217;t in yet, even though a lot of people do head to the airport in the morning.  I tried the third number, and got a &#8220;This number has been disconnected&#8221; message.  Oh dear.  Had we been duped?</p>

<p>Nope.  Called back the written number a few hours later and got a man with a heavy Russian accent.  I book us in for 6am on Saturday.  Fast forward to then&#8230; and no shuttle.  Another shuttle stopped to see if we wanted to come with them, and when I showed him our ticket he kind of laughed a little.  Oh dear.</p>

<p>At 6:15am, our shuttle arrived - on the other side of the street, and the driver jumped out telling us to &#8220;Hurry up! Hurry Up!&#8221;.  Never mind the fact there is traffic coming, we&#8217;re expected to run across the road, luggage and all.  The shuttle driver throws our bags in the back (I rescue my carry-on and its breakable glass from his clutches), we hop in, and away we go to pick up a few more fares.  This guy&#8217;s driving style is kind of kamakazi&#8230; if the next lane is going faster and there&#8217;s almost the space for the van, he squeezes in.  U-turns are a given, backing up is done without much forethought or without looking.  And in the front seat is his 6-month-old puppy, Igor, along for the ride and being a bit of a distraction (which is not what this driver needs!).</p>

<p>But, thank God, we arrive at the airport at about 7am, alive and with all pieces intact.  We waited in line a bit for it to open&#8230; our flight wasn&#8217;t until 10am, but we wanted to get exit row seats.. and luckily (there were maybe 20 people in line in front of us, but I suspect most of them were from the same tour group) we did!  And I picked up a Swatch at the duty free store!</p>

<p>This is getting LOOONG, I&#8217;m breaking it into a two-parter&#8230; see later for more@</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, tonight we find ourselves back in Sydney in the Railway Square YHA (my fav hostel of all thus far).  Got a super-early flight from Cairns to here.  Cairns was great, but I&#8217;m not a humidity-lovin&#8217; tropical kinda gal.Yesterday we went to Kuranda, a rainforest &#8220;village&#8221; a little ways from Cairns.  To get there you have three options: road, Scenic Railway or Skyrail.  Since we didn&#8217;t have a car and the Scenic Rail was closed due to mudslides last week, we took the Skyrail, a gondola over the rainforest and up the hills.  It was a little frightening to be so far up, but the view and the sounds of the rainforest were amazing.  In Katoomba, we opted to see some wildlife exhibits, specifically Birdworld, Butterfly Sanctuary and Koala Garden.  Birdworld was great but a little freaky as birds have a tendency to land on some people (specifically, they seem to like Brian.. he liked them less so, especially when one dude tried eating his shirt) and buzz past your head.  Butterfly Sanctuary was beautiful and informative&#8230; I now know more about butterflies than I ever have.  Koala Gardens was less informative but much more fun - I got to hold a koala and we hand-fed kangaroos and wallabies!!  Last night, after arriving back in Cairns, we cruised the Night Market for miscellaneous goodies and called it a night.</p>

<p>After arriving at the hostel this morning, we didn&#8217;t waste much time in making our way back up to Darling Harbour to check out the Chinese Gardens of Friendship (a traditional-style Chinese garden, created for Australia&#8217;s bicentennial) and Powerhouse Museum (a museum with exhibits in fashion, science and technology and so much more - we stayed until they closed it up).</p>

<p>Gonna go grab a bite to eat and maybe enjoy some duty-free Australian wine. :)  Be back in four days or so!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Or, rather, certified. Open Water Diver, that is. Did my four OW cert dives Saturday and Sunday on our Live-a-board tour of the Great Barrier Reef. It was very very fun, thanks to the group I got to do it with. Saw plenty of fish, turtles and coral to remember for a lifetime (swam with a turtle - he got between me and my dive buddy). Touched a nudibranch - go look that one up!</p>

<p>Going out to the Reef was less fun - the weather was a little windy, the waves were a little choppy, the boat was a little rocky, and Brian was a little sea sicky - for about one and a half days. Not the funnest thing in the world for him, to be sure. But an experience for him none the less. He was not able to dive&#8230; Australia is racist against asthmatics and thus he wasn&#8217;t allowed to don a tank and BCD. He did get to snorkel, as did I (my ears got a little wonky because of my cold the second day, so I opted to snorkel and was surprised and what you actually get to see!).</p>

<p>Besides diving, the other things to do on the boat were eating and sleeping. Food was good, IMO, thanks to the cook. And the rest of the divers were a fun bunch, from the UK and Switzerland and Denmark and the US mostly. We chatted and what-not, shared diving and non-diving stories. In fact, we&#8217;re off to have supper with the lot right now&#8230; tomorrow we get to Kuranda via the Skyrail over the rainforest, gonna see some wildlife (that means pics!), and back to Sydney on Wednesday super-early.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
