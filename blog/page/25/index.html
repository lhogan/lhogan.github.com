  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had a fairly good Christmas.  I did nothing academic and almost nothing thought-intensive.  Santa was good to me.  And reflecting, I&#8217;ve had a very good year.  I&#8217;ve been to many new places (Spain, New York, Calgary, Niagara Falls, and Fredericton).  I&#8217;ve kept in touch with many old friends and made several new ones.  I had a wonderful wedding and in doing so united with an amazing man.  I became a puppy mom.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are too many people around the world and even close to home who haven&#8217;t it as good as I have this year.  My ideal New Year&#8217;s wish would be to have everyone happy and healthy.  But I&#8217;m not delusionsal - that can&#8217;t possibly happen.  So my alternate New Year&#8217;s wish is more realistic, in that I hope people learn to be nicer to each other.  There is little we can do about natural disasters like the recent tsunami that has hurt so many.  But there&#8217;s a lot we can do about the hurt inflicted in small and big ways.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the age old New Year practise, I&#8217;ve created some resolutions I intend to keep.  You will all keep me accoutable, yes?  (These are numbered but are in no particular order.)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In keeping with my above comments, I will be a nicer person this year in the following ways:
a.  I will be kinder to my mother (I am not always as good as I should be), and will have more time for my parents.
b.  I will try to have more time for friends I&#8217;ve inadvertently ignored.
c.  I will be less &#8220;gossipy&#8221;.</p></li>
<li><p>I will be healthier, by:
a.  Following the <a href="http://www.weightwatchers.ca"> Weight Watchers </a> Points plan.
b.  Exercising 2 or more times the week by using my free gym membership.  Even if it&#8217;s just walking the track for ten minutes on a day when I feel too busy.  They say exercise is Nature&#8217;s Prozac&#8230; I&#8217;m gona put that claim to the test.</p></li>
<li><p>I will stop procrastinating, when it comes to:
a.  My research/thesis - I will finish by the end of the year for sure, by August preferably.
b.  Housework.
c.  Volunteer things I&#8217;m supposed to do - If they are not done in a week, I will fully admit I don&#8217;t have the time.</p></li>
<li><p>(Added Jan. 5) I will spend less time while at school doing &#8220;other&#8221; stuff, and less &#8220;other&#8221; time doing nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>(Added Jan. 6) I will NOT bite off more than I can chew.  My current WISE and IEEE activities, plus the occasional Beagle Paws volunteer thing are it - no more.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I may add more, but will not delete any.  I&#8217;ll keep you posted on my progress.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Not yet, anyway. :)  If you are looking for a different Christmas album, check out the Barenaked Ladies new one, &#8220;Barenaked for the Holidays&#8221;.  I love their collaboration with Sarah McLachlan, a mix of &#8220;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen&#8221; and &#8220;We Three Kings&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><ol>
<li>I actually sat down and watched &#8220;The Swan&#8221; on Fox last night.  It&#8217;s a reality-TV show where two women are picked to go through the &#8220;extreme makeover&#8221; scenario - consultation, surgery, workout regime, counselling, etc.  They are living away from family and friends for three months, with no mirror to show them their &#8220;progress&#8221;.  At the end of their &#8220;transformation&#8221;, they are shown their new self.  Then one of the two women are selected to compete for the the title of &#8220;The Swan&#8221;.</li>
</ol>


<p>Okay, the ONLY thing I like about the show is the fact that the women are given counselling to deal with old and new issues (last night&#8217;s episode, one women was still grieving and bitter over a miscarriage and ten years of failed fertility treatment).  BUT, this show is sending several false and horrible messages.  The first is &#8220;The average-looking woman is not good enough&#8221;.  The women on last night&#8217;s show weren&#8217;t &#8216;knock-outs&#8217; (I can say that because I&#8217;m not a &#8216;knock-out&#8217; either) before their transformations, but should we all have perfect teeth, legs and breasts?  Wouldn&#8217;t that be dull?  The second is &#8220;Life will be okay if you look perfect&#8221;.  You&#8217;ll obviously find love, money, and most of all happiness if you get your boobs done and some jaw implants.  It&#8217;s so absurd, but at the same time, if you think it&#8217;ll make you happy, then you likely won&#8217;t be happy without it. :(  The third message it seems to send (to the contestants at least) is &#8220;You need outside validation&#8221;.  Even after these women have done three months to make themselves new, they still have to compete in a pageant to earn the title of &#8220;The Swan&#8221;.  And only one of the two women on the show even get the chance to compete.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not enough to be hapy with yourself for who you are.  You have to be &#8216;perfect&#8217;, but even then you are only as good as what the judges say, if you make it that far, and then life will be wonderful&#8230;</p>

<p>It makes my head hurt.</p>

<ol>
<li>The year is 2004, almost 2005.  Women in Newfoundland and Canada have the same rights as men.  Why can&#8217;t we get paid the same if we are equally qualified?  I always thought that pay scales were based on experience and education.  Sure, there&#8217;s &#8220;wiggle room&#8221;for those that negotiate a better salary.  But there are guidelines and limits, right?  Apparently not!</li>
</ol>


<p>That also makes my head hurt.</p>

<p>Oh, the state of the world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, the commercialism that is Christmas is now upon us&#8230; at least for those who consider it like that. It&#8217;s hard not to feel put-upon when you&#8217;re hit with the Christmas carols and &#8220;sales&#8221; imediately following Hallowe&#8217;en (I gotta wonder if it&#8217;s just me, or if they really do start the holiday campaign earlier each year). That&#8217;s not what it&#8217;s supposed to be about. I can deal with the radio personality reminding me I have 14 shopping days&#8230; but at six weeks before Christmas, I have more important things to worry about than getting my sister-in-law the perfect sweater (note to Connie: you&#8217;re not getting a sweater, don&#8217;t worry. I can barely pick out clothing for myself, let alone other people).</p>

<p>I can understand those who feel so overwhelmed by the &#8220;assault to the senses&#8221; that they develop a dislike for the whole darn season. However, I feel bad for those who don&#8217;t enjoy Christmas (or Hannukah, Festivus or whatever it is your heritage celebrates). I am a self-confessed Christmas junkie in that I enjoy my holiday music (<a href="http://www.accuholiday.com/">http://www.accuholiday.com</a> has free streaming music in many varieties UPDATE on 15 December:  Accuradio has been down all day, it may be gone&#8230;). I love my Peppermint Hot Chocolate while I watch &#8220;A Charlie Brown Christmas&#8221;. I love the lights on the tree and the incense at church (though I think they&#8217;ve given up on the incense for various reasons). I love spending time with family, though the dynamics of my Christmas traditions change as two individuals become one family. Those are the things I enjoy. It may be different if I was away from my family, but I&#8217;d like to think I would adjust. Or at least amuse myself with all the holiday classics on DVD that I could find.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;m always fearful of becoming one of those scary sorts who start wearing &#8220;festive sweaters&#8221; and shopping in June. Please shoot me if I become one of those.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I didn&#8217;t say it first (Charles Shultz did), but I&#8217;ll happily agree. December is definitely starting to let us know it&#8217;s arrived. We&#8217;ve had a bit of snow, and it&#8217;s chilly and wet out. But my beagle April and I are currently curled up on the couch (yay, laptop). This is her first December with us (she&#8217;s a rescued beagle, from <a href="http://www.beaglepaws.com/"> Beagle Paws </a>) and it&#8217;s fun to watch her inspect the first snowfall. This dog has me wrapped around her paw. I can&#8217;t remember what I did with my time before her, but now I spend a good deal of time walking her, playing &#8220;Hide-the-treat&#8221;, watching her nest in our bed or on the couch, sleeping next to her in bed, talking to her, talking ABOUT her&#8230; Okay, I have a problem. I know it. But I&#8217;m not ready to seek help.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If this works, great. If it doesn&#8217;t&#8230; you&#8217;ll never know, will you? I&#8217;m starting a blog to be cool&#8230; no, to write. Apparently I have a &#8220;thesis&#8221; to write sometime soon, but my writing skills are rusty. Plus, I have trouble starting. And in the words of someone, &#8220;It&#8217;s better to write anything than nothing.&#8221; So yes, I am fully aware that I cannot append the blog to my thesis, or that anyone will be impressed if I start posting literature reviews. But at least I&#8217;m writing something!</p>
