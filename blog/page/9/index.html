  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few months back, when I got full-time permanent employment, I went shopping.  Not just to celebrate - mostly because every work-wearable shirt I owned had some sort of food stain on it.</p>

<p>And this morning, I thought I was safe with the long sleeve tshirt I selected.  Wrong -  there&#8217;s a mystery stain on THIS one as well.  Argh.  Bibs would be welcome.</p>

Hurrah!  Finally got around to putting the pic up.  The phone, she is a <a href="http://www.nokiausa.com/phones/6585">Nokia 6585</a>, and originally had a boring gray cover.  I needed to change that.  So here she is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a busy sort of week for my little puppy boy.  It started off great last weekend - the <a href="http://www.beaglepaws.com">Beagle Paws</a> reunion was Sunday at Mundy Pond Visitors&#8217; Centre.  We obviously all went.  April barked quite a lot, but was generally well-behaved (she may be mellowing).  Wesley was the social butterfly, sniffing and being sniffed, and had the record (slowest) time for the obstacle course!  We left happy.</p>

<p>On the way home, I had to stop at work to pick something up.  It was while I ran to my office that Brian noticed blood in the back seat.  Further inspection revealed that Wesley was bleeding - more than a little bit.  The source of the blood was detected (cut on the pad of his back right paw) and B did his best to make him comfy while we tried to track down a vet, which is no small task here on a Sunday.  After calling their emergency line, we drove towards and sat in the lot of the vet clinic until someone happened to be leaving.  But the bleeding was stopped by then, things seemed okay, so we were sent home and told to come back during normal business hours.</p>

<p>Which we did, first thing Monday morning.  Dr. Laite saw him and his wound (which by now was doing okay) and deemed him okay&#8230; which he seemed to be.  But the gosh-darn bandage she put on came off Monday afternoon, and the bleeding stated again.  And kept going, everytime he managed to get the bandage off or we needed to change it.</p>

<p>Back to the vet.  This time, it bled when she unwrapped it.  A lot.  There was a concern he may have a clotting problem (think hemophila), but tests for that came back normal (thank goodness).  The next step was surgery, to determine if maybe something was in his wound.</p>

<p>So yesterday, my little puppy boy went in for surgery to see what was the cause of the blood.  Turns out there was nothing in the wound, but whatever made the cut nicked an artery.  Ouch.  That was taken care of quickly, and at the same time we had a lump removed form the side of his paw.</p>

<p>So now he is recovering.  His exercise is limited for the next 10 days (like that matters to him, he&#8217;d be sleeping anyway), he&#8217;s got some pills to ward off infection, and he&#8217;ll be fine.  As will the rest of us. :)</p>

<p>Weight Update:  Lost another pound this week, meaning I&#8217;m down 16.6 lbs since January.  Not a lot but better than up!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I haven&#8217;t talked about this for a while.  I&#8217;m still trying to lose weight and be healthier.  I&#8217;m currently 15.6 lbs lighter today than I was in the beginning of January.  I still have 20-30 lbs to go to be at a &#8220;happy&#8221;, healthy weight.  I&#8217;m still working out (sporadically), still tracking points, still drinking litres and litres of water.  I&#8217;ll keep ya posted!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I realized that I&#8217;m no longer feeling green-and-orange, the old template colours.  I&#8217;m a bit more muted&#8230; a little more introspective.  Looking across the proverbial ocean at the future.  So, I&#8217;ve made some changes.  Feel free to find errors, critique something, tell me you like it, whatever.  I <em>know</em> I need some sort of separator line between postings.. that irks me.  But generally, I&#8217;m okay with it.</p>

<p>And I&#8217;ve updated my Random Links&#8230;. though I must admit, the sidebar&#8217;s a little wonky right now, especially in Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>Also check out <a href="http://www.usanetwork.com/sports/westminsterdogshow/dogfun/profiler/">this link</a>, where you can do another test.  I did it four times, and each time the questions were slightly different.  Judging from the results I&#8217;m half Siberian Husky (forgetful, loyal and goofy) and Golden Retriever (loyal, lovable).</p>
