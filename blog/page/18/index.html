  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/">Stumbled</a> across this link, <a href="http://author.forbiddenlibrary.com/">Forbidden Library: Banned and Censored Books</a>.  Take a look at a few of these that were banned:</p>

<p>Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl. Challenged in Wise County, Va. (1982) due to &#8220;sexually offensive&#8221; passages. Four members of the Alabama State Textbook Committee (1983) called for the rejection of this book because it is a &#8220;real downer.&#8221; &#8230;. War and genocide usually are such downers, aren&#8217;t they?</p>

<p>My Friend Flicka. Removed from fifth and sixth grade optional reading lists in Clay County, Fla. schools (1990) because the book uses the word &#8220;bitch&#8221; to refer to a female dog, as well as the word &#8220;damn.&#8221; &#8230;. Okay, first off, &#8220;bitch&#8221; IS a female dog!  Second, 95% of kids have heard the word &#8220;damn&#8221; before (does anyone actually say &#8220;Damn!&#8221;?  I don&#8217;t).  The 5% who haven&#8217;t heard it are Amish.</p>

<p>The Lorax, by Dr. Seuss. Challenged in the Laytonville, Calif. Unified School District (1989) because it &#8220;criminalizes the foresting industry.&#8221; &#8230; and the Cat in the Hat promotes animal cruelty?</p>

<p>Zen Buddhism: Selected Writings. Challenged at the Plymouth-Canton school system in Canton, Mich. (1987) because &#8220;this book details the teachings of the religion of Buddhism in such a way that the reader could very likely embrace its teachings and choose this as his religion.&#8221; The last thing we need are a bunch of peaceful Buddhists running around. The horror.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So&#8230; my streak of good driving luck has come to an end.  Yesterday saw two minor mishaps - no one hurt but my pride, and no major damage.</p>

<p>1)  I was on auto pilot yesterday morning.  I kissed Brian, he opened the door&#8230; or a door slammed so I started to leave.  But it wasn&#8217;t Brian getting out the car.  It was the car behind me.  So I start to take off while his ass is still on the car seat, his feet on the ground.  He, being more awake than I was, leaped out and yelled at me to stop.</p>

<p>2)  In an effort not to melt yesterday I headed home to work yesterday afternoon.  Getting into my driveway was fine.  Backing out, I scraped the car parked across the street slightly.  Nobody in it, the guy who owned it wasn&#8217;t home so I left my name and number.  He got back to me today (I&#8217;m such a wimp, I asked Brian to call him for me) and he&#8217;s not too worried about it.</p>

<p>So please be careful around me&#8230; I&#8217;d suggest trying to teleport into the car.  I&#8217;m fine with the driving stuff - it&#8217;s the stopping-going part.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had the priviledge of hanging out with my 12-year old cousin Danielle yesterday.  IMO, we had a good day.  Dairy Queen, followed by a movie, followed by glow-in-the-dark mini golf, followed by Chapters, then BBQ and then fireworks.  The movie of choice (and I&#8217;ll admit, it was her choice), was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0380623/">The Perfect Man</a>, featuring a rather old looking Heather Locklear, an ever-handsome Chris Noth (&#8220;Mr. Big&#8221;), and an annoyingly-perky-but-still-wholesome-for-now Hilary Duff.  And it was a rather good movie for a matinee. Fairly fluffy - the story revolves around a single mom who moves everytime she&#8217;s dumped by a loser boyfriend she&#8217;s hooked up with for fear of ending up alone.  She&#8217;s a baker - must be a good salary to have the money to keep moving.  Her kids, Hilary and little sister, are dragged along with every move, and by the time they reach Brooklyn (the movie&#8217;s setting) Hilary, at least, is sick of it.  And afraid her mom is going to hook up with another loser.  So she creates a man to &#8220;satisfy&#8221; her mother&#8217;s need for romance.</p>

<p>I know, by now you&#8217;re saying &#8220;Yeah, wasn&#8217;t this all in the trailer?&#8221;.  I thought it may be exactly that - seen the trailer, seen the movie.  But the ending, while not earth-shaking, is a bit different than what I expected - which is really surprising because usually, everything Hilary Duff is in is pretty cookie-cutter.  But if you are looking for a good way to spend an afternoon, go see it.  Or at least, rent it when it comes out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Note to Divinity:  After writing my rant I went on over to read your happenings and saw the pics from &#8220;Guys and Dolls&#8221;.  Please note I&#8217;m not accusing you of being a staker or anything with this rant - I would have waited around to see Ewan too, but I wouldn&#8217;t ask him what colour his underwear are or anything.</strong></p>

<p>We are in a real-time information age - when something happens, we can be instantly aware, thanks to the internet and cable television.  So when Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes got engaged on top of the Eiffel Tower last week, everyone knew, likely before she got the chance to tell her mom.  When Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt share a glance, we can read all about it on cnn.com, along with Jennifer Aniston&#8217;s immediate breakdown caused by it.  But I&#8217;ve gotta ask&#8230;. do we care?  I&#8217;ll be honest in saying I read the gossip as much as the average person, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m taken in by it.</p>

<p>I have two qualms about the sport of celebrity-watching.  My first is that I don&#8217;t think these people are worthy of the attention the media gives them.  Most have risen to fame because of their acting and/or singing and/or athletic abilities&#8230; but what have they done that actually makes a difference?  I know most celebrities have causes that mean &#8220;something&#8221; to them, and those that are doing it out of the goodness of their hearts deserve recognition for it.  But does a great actor/actress/singer mean more to the world than a great teacher/researcher/engineer/scientist?  What about a great humanitarian or animal rights activist?  Celebrities are more-or-less the same as you or me.  Granted, they have more money and can be a little kookier (hey you, Michael Jackson - yeah, you&#8217;re kooky), but they don&#8217;t have super powers.  They are people.</p>

<p>My second qualm comes from the sentence of the last paragraph.  While it must be acknowledged that those (for the most part) in the limelight have chosen their path, is it fair to assume that we have the right to intrude into their lives and know every little detail?  Some (like Tom and Katie) want the world to know what&#8217;s going on.  Others prefer to keep their personal lives private, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the right of the media to go beyond &#8220;reasonable&#8221; journalistic techniques to get the scoop.  Chasing, stalking, or T-boning a celebrity&#8217;s car are way beyond reasonable.  Even the minor celebrities get caught into it - those of you who watch G4&#8217;s &#8220;Attack of the Show!&#8221; (formerly The Screensavers) may know about Kevin and Sarah&#8217;s relationship which is apparently no more.  Who knows if it really is or isn&#8217;t, and if Kevin is or isn&#8217;t seeing Amber from TechTV Canada&#8217;s &#8220;Call for Help&#8221;.  Is there a need to badger these people via their websites to find out more?  No, nor is it right to  share your assumptions that the choices they may or may not have made are not the right ones.  Do you know these people personally?  No?  Then leave them alone.  Do you think Katie and Tom are a publicity stunt?  Well then, let them play it out and when it&#8217;s over you can say &#8220;I told ya so!&#8221;, but why waste the energy speculating and arguing about it right now?  Think Angelina and Brad are sleeping together?  If they aren&#8217;t talking about it in public, does the media need to ask them time and time again?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong> Note that &#8220;Buddy&#8221; can now be found as &#8220;Andy&#8221; on the <a href="http://www.spcashelter.nf.ca/adoptions.asp?type=DOG">SPCA website</a> and the <a href="http://www.beaglepaws.com/adoption.html">Beagle Paws</a> website </strong></p>

<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t read the Telegram on the weekends, <a href="http://www.beaglepaws.com/newsJune05.html">this story</a> was in it - a story of three beagles that were severly abused and then dumped like garbage.  Such abuse could only come from the hands of a sick and twisted person.  I can only hope that somebody&#8217;s neighbour read this story and realized that their neighbour&#8217;s hunting dogs are gone.</p>

<p>Sometime around midnight on Sunday, we got a knock on the door (not that they needed to knock - April was on the ball as chief door bell).  It was a couple of neighbourhood teens with a stray and injured beagle.  They weren&#8217;t sure if it was one of ours or not, but this dog was very scared and was following them.  He had some wounds on his forhead and leg.</p>

<p>So, like the person Brian is (kind and caring!), he took the beagle to the back yard and made a place for him in the shed - not as comfy as indoors, but still dry and out of the wind, and away from a potential dog fight either out on the streets or inside our house :) .  In the morning I stayed with him for a bit (we brought him to Brian&#8217;s parents&#8217; place to avoid conflict) and got to know him (we thought of him as &#8220;Buddy&#8221;) and he is darling!  Playful, cuddly, cute and well-behaved!</p>

<p>In the afternoon, we brought him to the SPCA shelter.  Those people are wonderful, and I know he&#8217;s in good hands (either he&#8217;ll find his owner or he&#8217;ll find a new family), but seeing all those pups and kitties looking for homes is depressing.  I wish everyone would spay or neuter their pets - saves everyone a lot of grief and potential heartbreak!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I woke up at 6 am this morning all panicky (is that how one spells it?).  That&#8217;s been happening to me a bit lately.  Not so much waking up, but two or three times last week I was in the middle of something (a conversation, using the photocopy machine, etc.) and I literally stopped in dead panic, trying to remember what it is I think I have forgotten.  And since I have a lot to do, it&#8217;s quite possible I&#8217;ve forgotten something.  The past few instances, I don&#8217;t think in hindsight there was anything I forgot, still&#8230; I could use a <a href="http://www.hp-lexicon.org/magic/devices_n-r.html#Remembrall">Rememberall</a></p>

<p>I worry about me.  I may just be cracking up.  So one needs some light-hearted goodness when one is cracking up.  I&#8217;d appreciate some suggestions, but I have been re-reading Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix to relax.  This is probably about the 8th time I have read it, but this time I&#8217;m actually reading ALL the words (I have a bad reading habit - I sometime skim trying to get to the end).  But this time, the book is better than I remember and the details!  It really is awesome!  I&#8217;ve also been ganging up on the weeds in the gardens with my new-fangled dandelion puller.</p>
