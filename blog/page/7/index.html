  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have bits of pieces of the flu.  One bit is sinus pressure and another is achiness, so I took a few hours off work this afternoon to medicate and nap.  I feel bad when I do this, because it&#8217;s not like I lost an arm&#8230; I could, in theory, still work, though I can&#8217;t promise I&#8217;d be productive.  I hurt but don&#8217;t have many extraneous symptomes, so then I wonder if people wonder if I&#8217;m faking it to get a few hours off (though, with the vacation time given at work I have no reason to lie).  Maybe I should just tell them it&#8217;s a &#8220;feminine thing&#8221; and watch the men squirm. :)</p>

<p>Gonna go take a muscle relaxer and&#8230; well, relax.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ah-HA!  I <a href="http://www.lorihogan.com/2006/08/07/comma-power/">previously wrote</a> on the contract dispute between <a href="http://www.shoprogers.com/homeen.asp?CustomerType=Consumer&amp;Language=En">Rogers </a>and <a href="http://bell.aliant.ca/english/index.asp">Aliant</a>, and how a misplaced (or maybe intentionally placed by Aliant but overlooked by Rogers) comma means that Aliant has the right to terminate the lease Rogers has on thousands of telephone poles in New Brunswick.
Well now Rogers is hitting back - en francais.  In <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20061015.wxr-comma161/BNStory/Business/?cid=al_gam_nletter_newsUp">this Globe and Mail story</a>, they argue that the French version of the contract does not have the same punctuation and conveys the meaning they (Rogers) thought the contract said in the first place.  The contract was originally created and then translated, but each contract was individually signed by both parties.</p>

<p>My thought - if the contracts say different things when they are supposed to be the same, wouldn&#8217;t BOTH now be declared void? My other thought - how the heck do lawyers sleep at night? :)</p>

A sunny Sunday, 10a.m.
I&#8217;m letting the dog out to pee again
She comes back in, I make some toast
A bang on the house, could it be a ghost?</p>

<p>I peer out the curtains; no damage done
My eyes adjust to the blinding sun
I look to the ground, and there I see
The cause of commotion, a downed birdie</p>

<p>I can only assume you were out for a spin
Enjoying the autumn, catching the wind
Unable to see with your eyes with the glare
That it was our front window in front of you there</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sorry I couldn&#8217;t do much more to aid
I went out to see you but you got afraid
You tried to escape but with the injuries sustained
You could not go far, now you&#8217;re no longer pained</p>

<p>But you were a Flicker, red, black and brown
A beautiful woodpecker, even when down
I hope life was good for you, hope you had friends
Sorry about the accident, No hard feelings, the End</p>

<p>(A <a href="http://www.enature.com/fieldguides/detail.asp?recnum=BD0427">Northern Flicker</a> flew into our front window Sunday morning&#8230; I felt bad, but what&#8217;s a girl to do?)</p>

<p>](http://www.lorihogan.com/uploaded_images/sh-718985.JPG)
It&#8217;s been a surprisingly busy few weekends, considering I&#8217;m not known as a social butterfly or anything.  Last weekend was birthday party and anniversary celebration, this weekend was SpiritFest and Sarah Harmer, of which I write now.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t remember the &#8220;when&#8221; of getting hooked on Sarah Harmer&#8230; it was after her first solo album (You Were Here), before the second(All of our Names).  She&#8217;s not what you&#8217;d call mainstream Canadian pop or anything.. some parts are pop, some are country, some are folky and bluegrassy&#8230;. you know what? I don&#8217;t know how to classify her, and I don&#8217;t think I want to try.  We were fortunate enough to see her in concert two years back at the Arts and Culture Centre, and I was thrilled when i found out she was gonna be back.  Different venue, this time around it was Holy Heart of Mary Auditorium, in a formerly Catholic-girls school, now home to heathen of both sexes and many religions.  Different format this time, no opening act (at ACC it was Josh Ritter, who I knew nothing of before that concert and now think he&#8217;s totally awesome) and more band than I remember.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;d rate it five stars out of five.  Many favorites from &#8220;You Were Here&#8221; and &#8220;All of Our Names&#8221; - Coffee Stain, Pendulums, Tether, Dandelions in Bullet Holes, Around this Corner - were played, along with some non-standard stuff (a cover of a Dave Hodge/Music Maul song that was interesting, &#8220;Black Coffee&#8221; off &#8220;Songs for Clem&#8221;).  She got the chance to shine solo for two or three songs when the band left, but the band itself is a definite complement to her style. Take her beautiful voice and add the flute, clarinet, piano, guitar, mandolin and that thingie I don&#8217;t know the name of (electric mouth piano?), and it sounds perfect. And, for the record, the clarinet rocks&#8230; it&#8217;s all about playing standing up.</p>

<p>And, to cap off a great concert, there was a two-song encore: &#8220;Lodestar&#8221;, my favorite Sarah Harmer song, and &#8220;How Deep in the Valley&#8221;, sung a cappella by all band members at the edge of the stage.  A wonderful closing. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, must get this out of the way before starting the post.</p>

<p>Zach Braff is dreamy.</p>

<p>Okay, let&#8217;s continue.  Last night I took in the movie &#8220;The Last Kiss&#8221; with B, Nikki, Kerry and Carla (who is the only one of us without a blog&#8230; jump on the bandwagon!).  I&#8217;m a big fan of Zach Braff (see above statement), of Scrubs, of the last movie I saw him in, Garden State, which he also directed.  I&#8217;m also a fan of Crash, the Academy Award winning movie cco-written by Paul Haggis, who wrote this adaptation of a 2001 Spanish movie.  I think Rachel Bilson, from The O.C. (which, I must admit, I&#8217;ve seen maybe half an episode), is a cutie.  Thus, it seem only fair I like this movie.</p>

<p>And I did, for the most part.  Zach plays the part of Michael, a 29 year old architect (pet peeve - the ratio of architects on TV/movies compared ot the number present in real life is way to disproportionate&#8230; why aren&#8217;t there more engineers in pop culture?) who is about to be a daddy.  He lives with his girlriend/babymommy Jenna (played by Jacinda Barrett, who to me seemed almost too mature for her role), who we gather is a PhD student in something-or-other (that&#8217;s not important I guess&#8230; a commentary on the roles women play, or am I reading too much in there?), but is afraid of marriage.  At a friend&#8217;s wedding he chats up a young hottie Kim (Rachel Bilson), and admits he&#8217;s in a crisis&#8230; and things play out from there.  I don&#8217;t want to say too much, but you can probably guess what happens.</p>

<p>I think the movie deals with a lot of issues that many people my age are facing (whether they realize it or wish to admit it)right now - growing up, becoming committed (in relationships, not in the psych ward), buying property, having kids, etc. etc. when you really don&#8217;t feel old enough for it.  I can definitely relate to that.  Ten years ago, I figured by the time I got to where I am right now (turned 27 a week and a half ago, celebrated our second anniversary two days ago, own a house and two dogs), I&#8217;d feel more mature.  I&#8217;d act more mature.  But nope&#8230; most days I feel like an imposter, acting like an adult and hoping no one will catch on and ground me for a month for drinking and staying out so late.</p>

<p>So, I&#8217;d suggest seeing it.  But it&#8217;s just as good watched curled up on the couch than in the theatre.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, seems everywhere you turn Newfoundland is making National News for something or another.  My basis of this post started over on <a href="http://www.fark.com">Fark</a>, where they picked up the <a href="http://forums.fark.com/cgi/fark/comments.pl?IDLink=2312220">Fight Club</a> that got busted up in Corner Brook.  Teens are getting more and more dumb, aren&#8217;t they?  But even dumber are the people who choose to comment on Fark.  Even if you don&#8217;t know where a place is, there is nothing preventing a person with at least four fingers and an internet connection (which the commenters obviously have) from finding out NF is not part of Europe, and we don&#8217;t say aboot. :)</p>

<p>There was also the recent Nissan ad for the <a href="http://www.nissan.ca/en/vehicles/xtrail/bonavista.html">Bonavista edition of the Nissan X-Trail</a> that&#8217;s got some <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2006/09/14/nissan-bonavista.html">Newfoundlanders up in arms</a>.  (A search of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m-y-qAbpL0">YouTube </a>can find the ad for you if you haven&#8217;t seen it).  To be perfectly honest, I don&#8217;t see anything wrong with the television ad.. in fact, I find it somewhat hilarious.  A major bone of contention seems to be the fact that the actor is from Cape Breton and not a Newfoundlander, which is silly (really, they&#8217;re just Newfoundlanders we kicked off the West Coast, right? :). It doesn&#8217;t seem to be putting down - the seller knows what he&#8217;s talking about in terms of the car&#8217;s features and fine points.  He&#8217;s the one in charge of the situation.  It may not be exactly how people from Bonavista talk, but that&#8217;s not the point.  The point is that we have an accent that should be celebrated&#8230; and used to sell SUVs:).  But a local car dealer, City Honda (who, IMO, do great radio ads), <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/cp/Oddities/060925/K092518U.html">has retaliated</a>.</p>

<p>In general, Newfoundlanders get too touchy over these things sometimes.  I have my &#8220;Newfoundland boiling points&#8221;&#8230; don&#8217;t ever make the mistake of placing Newfoundland in the Maritime in front of ME.  But why can&#8217;t we be proud</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been busy lately.  The &#8220;start of fall&#8221; (which, yes, technically isn&#8217;t until September 23 this year, but forever in my mind fall always starts once Labour Day has passed and school starts) always awakens a flurry of activity as we shake of the lazy hazy summer days.</p>

<p>Last weekend found me in Toronto hosting an IEEE workshop, this time for GOLD.  In my opinion and despite my best procrastination efforts, it went well, and I think most would agree.  I must definitely admit that I need some help in keeping track of time and keeping conversations on track.  And to learn that 5:00am is not the best time to do slides.  But&#8230; whatever.  No one got hurt.  The work&#8217;s not over, not by a long shot.  But the pressure is less.</p>

<p>Work is interesting, though I sometimes feel isolated at my desk, programming and writing.  I like the company, like most of the people most of the time (there are always times when the best people get on your nerves, and there are some people who will always clash), and like the projects.</p>

<p>I leave it here for now.  Be good!</p>
