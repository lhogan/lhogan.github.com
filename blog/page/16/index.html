  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, granted Pearl Jam has never been here to little old St. John&#8217;s (to the best of my knowledge), but I never would have dreamed they would come.  But here they are, as part of their cross-Canada tour!  First off, I&#8217;m entirely pleased that a band (be they American, Canadian, British or Swahili) recognized that Canada doesn&#8217;t end at Halifax like so many have before.  Went to last night&#8217;s show (they are playing 2 shows here!  Would love to, but can&#8217;t justify, getting tix for tonight&#8217;s show), and must admit that in my mind it was the best concert I have EVER been to (sorry Dave M.) and will be very hard to top in the future.</p>

<p>I have no shame in admitting I&#8217;m mostly familiar with three of their albums (the older albums) - Ten, Vs. and Vitology - but was thrilled they played so much of their older stuff.  And I got a taste of some of the stuff I&#8217;ve missed since I stopped buying their albums (somewhere in high school, I guess)&#8230; I&#8217;m planning on checking some more of it out!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a plan this afternoon.  A good one, involving getting something done (paperwork to maintain the interest-free status on my student loan), walking and outdoors (getting it signed by school and brought to the bank).  I was gonna go to the Registrar&#8217;s Office, get the form signed, and then walk to Churchill Square.  Good times!</p>

<p>First stop was the Registrar&#8217;s Office to get the paperwork, fill it in and get it signed.  First snag:  They no longer sign the forms for graduate students.  The Office of Graduate Studies (in their need to feel needed, I&#8217;m guessing) now does it.</p>

<p>So I trotted on over to their new digs in the Inco Innovation Centre (there&#8217;s an indoor waterfall!).  Second snag:  I couldn&#8217;t just get it signed as in previous years, but rather had to leave it there and can come retrieve it &#8220;tomorrow afternoon&#8221;.  Argh!  I liked the old way, because the old way meant I could go today, when the weather is nice, and maybe hit Timmy&#8217;s on the way back for a tea and a cookie.</p>

<p>In this case, change is bad.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Quick note:  I&#8217;m uber-busy travelling a researching (ah!  such is the life I lead) from now until the end of October.  The rush of first-years into university has depressed me - why am I still here? So I plan to say Good Bye to campus at the end of this semester.</p>

<p>So apologies if I&#8217;m not keeping you in on my happenings&#8230; I&#8217;ll post when I can.</p>

Dear CNN:  Please give me a break.  I understand that you are certainly not to blame for Hurricane Katrina and the aftermath that followed in New Orleans and other parts of Mississippi and Louisiana.  In fact, I&#8217;m sure the ground coverage you are providing gives the idiots who failed to plan for such a scenario great insight into what they did wrong and how people are paying for it.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;ve become addicted to watching the disaster recovery unfold, the way some people can&#8217;t help but look at a car wreck as they drive past.  This age of instant news via TV and internet provides us with a continuous car wreck and unobstructed view of the twisted metal.  I&#8217;d like to get away from all the disaster please, and walk instead through the beauty of nature, to be reminded that though some people have it extremely tough right now, life is still good and more importantly, will still go on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To keep me happy on a Friday afternoon, I&#8217;m listening to <a href="http://www.edge.ca">Edge 102.1</a> from Toronto.  This weekend they are celebrating 1991 by playing some music (3 songs, to be exact) from that year each hour.  The DJ who is kicking it all off admitted to being 6 in 1991 (I feel old - I was 12 in 1991).</p>

<p>The first song?  Any guesses what one of the most influential album and song of 1991 were?  Here&#8217;s a hint&#8230;. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000003TA4/qid=1125080084/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_2/104-3762065-5783155?v=glance&amp;s=music&amp;n=507846">click here</a> first song from this album.  The fact that this song/album came out <strong>14 years ago</strong> makes me feel old too.  My 26th birthday is coming up&#8230; it&#8217;s not the number but the difference and distance from years gone by that bothers me.</p>

<p>The second song played from 1991?  Much less angry, but definitely memorable&#8230;. song # 14 from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000002LU8/qid=1125080305/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-3762065-5783155?v=glance&amp;s=music">here</a>.  If you don&#8217;t know the words, or own a real green dress&#8230; I&#8217;m truly disappointed in your lack of Canadiana, or realize you&#8217;re just not old enough.</p>

<p>The third song&#8230; consider this&#8230;. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0006ICF9A/qid=1125080492/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/104-3762065-5783155?v=glance&amp;s=music">song # 2</a>.</p>

<p>The DJ just said, &#8220;1991, what a good year&#8221;&#8230; you were 6!!  Grade 1!!  You are not able to say that.</p>

<p>I digress.  Any other goods ones form that time?  I would vote for &#8220;Even Flow&#8221; off of Pearl Jam&#8217;s Ten, that came out in 1991&#8230; what else?  Old age must be affecting my memory.</p>

<p>Edit:  More songs played in the spirit of 1991 &#8211;
&#8220;Enter Sandman&#8221;, Metallica (head-banging, anyone?)
&#8220;Political&#8221;, Spirit of the West (throw-back hippy?)
&#8220;American Music&#8221;, Violent Femmes (one song I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever heard)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those who keep up on such things, Google has released its competitor to MSN Messenger and Skype, <a href="http://talk.google.com">Google Talk</a>.  It&#8217;s installed and running on my two main computers, and so far so good, but I highly agree with this <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,68642,00.html?tw=rss.TOP">Wired article</a> - it needs to do something quickly to get some of those used to Messenger, emoticons and bells and whistles, to come on over.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This past weekend was full of sex movies for me, and none of them were porn.  Friday night we rented <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362269/">Kinsey</a>.  It based on the life of the first sexologist, Dr. Alfred Kinsey (or &#8216;Prok&#8217; as his students, colleagues and even his wife called him) and his work.  Liam Neeson does a great job as Kinsey - not once did he make me think of Star Wars.  His wife, Clara McMillen or &#8216;Mac&#8217;, is greatly done by Laura Linney.  We&#8217;re taken a bit through Alfred&#8217;s childhood (and are introduced to his largely religious engineer father, played by John Lithgow) but the majority of the movie focuses on relationships - between Prok and Mac and their initial, er, problem, between Prok and his students/colleagues - and on the research he completed detailing the sexual habits of men and women in America.  You&#8217;ve got to admire the man, who was brave enough to tackle documenting sexual practises at a time when many thought there was only sexual position, and that was man on top, woman on bottom.  There&#8217;s a great scene with Kinsey and two newlywed students who just aren&#8217;t &#8216;feeling it, and he&#8217;s trying to get them to open up about what they do and finds out all these misconceptions they have, but there&#8217;s no research to prove otherwise.</p>

<p>Saturday night I got the chance to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405422/">The 40 Year Old Virgin</a>.  This is by far the funniest movie I have seen in a VERY long time.  Andy Stitzer is a guy who collects comic book characters, works at a &#8220;big-box&#8221; electronics store&#8230; he could be a friend of mine. But he&#8217;s a little older than the crowd I hang around with, and well&#8230;.. he&#8217;s a virgin.  The movie is great in the way it tackles the movie&#8217;s theme - to get Andy laid - without making it disgusting or vulgar (no hair gel or pie scenes, in fact there&#8217;s only one great masturbation scene in the movie).  His friends (well, they start out as co-workers who needed a fifth for their poker game) actually seem to care about him.  Jane Lynch plays the store manager, and brings to it bits of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0218839/">Best in Show</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310281/">A Mighty Wind</a>.</p>
