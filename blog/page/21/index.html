  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230; without blowing smoke in our faces.  I&#8217;m a huge supporter of banning smoking in bars.  And this story on VOCM bothers me.</p>

<hr />

<p>Beverage Industry Releases Stats
April 20, 2005</p>

<p>Bar owners in Newfoundland and Labrador have come up with statistics indicating butts and booze do go together well. The Pub and Bar Coalition of Canada says an analysis shows that smoking bans in Ontario have resulted in a drop in revenue of between 18 and 24 per cent in cities like Ottawa, London and Kingston. Beverage Industry Association president Marcel Ethridge says it&#8217;s further proof of why the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador should not go ahead with plans to bring in a province-wide smoking ban.</p>

<hr />

<p>I do feel for business owners who may be affected, and realize that they are looking out for their own butts (pardon the pun) BUT&#8230;
-  &#8220;Lies, damn lies and statistics&#8221;&#8230; over how long did it take for the revenues to drop, and did they come back?  Was it a drop caused by a change in season?  A drop from what point in time (same time last year, month before.. what?)? Not enough info!
-  Was the revenue drop specifically because there was no smoking and therefore less people, or are people just drinking less?
-  If people are drinking less&#8230; well, from a health perspective, is that such a BAD thing?</p>

<p>Ponder it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You may or may not know of my irrational fear. I fear something normal people do everyday. Even (and I hate to offend anyone) the dumbest, most inept people in the world can do this. I <em>can</em> do it too, but I am afraid to. It&#8217;s driving. More specifically, it&#8217;s mainly parking a car after driving somewhere, but it&#8217;s also the thought of driving on a busy road, trying to change lanes or making a left-hand turn into oncoming traffic without a flashing sorrow. It&#8217;s pretty bad, but I get weak-kneed at the thought of Kenmount Road on a Thursday afternoon, all alone in the car.</p>

<p>Most of it stems from an incident I had parking my dad&#8217;s car years ago, when I was foolish enough to listen to my mom&#8217;s advice (she&#8217;s a non-driver). Part of it likely stems from that, that my mom never drove and gets through life (kind of). Part of it probably comes from really low self-confidence and a penchant for being clumsy all by myself, let alone when commandeering a large vehicle made of metal (or plastic, yay Saturn!). Part of it may be I didn&#8217;t drive in the first year after getting my license (my dad wouldn&#8217;t teach me to drive his standard, so I learned to drive automatic from a local driving school).</p>

<p>In any case, I&#8217;m not going to blame anyone but myself. I&#8217;m silly silly silly to fear something most of the world can do almost as naturally as breathing. It&#8217;s a hindrance - more than once I&#8217;ve come up with excuses for not going somewhere when really, I can&#8217;t think of how I can get there and I don&#8217;t want to ask for a ride and feel dependent. I hate being dependent on others in this case, and Lord knows public transportation in St. John&#8217;s/Mount Pearl is not convenient (reliable yes, but once an hour only) if you want to meet up with someone. But what&#8217;s inconvenient is passing by Brian&#8217;s work on the way to drop me off to school, only to have him backtrack - it&#8217;s at least 15 minutes that could be spent sleeping.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve made the first step (not the first time, I know) - I&#8217;ve admitted to the world (that&#8217;s you) that I am silly, I realize this and would like to change. Now, according to the literature, I need to confront my fear in a safe way&#8230; when I find that way, I&#8217;ll let you know.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the course of every long, harsh winter I&#8217;ve ever experienced(and being one who doesn&#8217;t particularly like winter, they have ALL been long and harsh), I forget what spring feels like. I was fortunate enough to get a break of warmth and sunshine when I hit New Orleans last month, but it didn&#8217;t feel like spring - it&#8217;s forever &#8220;warm&#8221; (by our standards) down there, so something was missing, like the smell of damp earth or the slight chill in the air. It was more like being transplanted to June than being introduced to an early spring. But I only remember what the experience of spring is like when it starts, and each year it seems I&#8217;m amazed that winter is finally over and the world is ready to begin again - to start with the barren landscape covered with transplanted rocks left over from winter and turn it into canvas coloured with various shades of green, yellow and more.</p>

<p>I know that winter will have one (at least) final hurrah, but I&#8217;m uplifted by the warmth of the sunshine through my light fleece jacket; by the puddles and rivers created by melting snow; by the hint of blooms that are pushing their way through the earth in my parent&#8217;s front yard; and by all the other ways spring has announced its arrival.</p>
