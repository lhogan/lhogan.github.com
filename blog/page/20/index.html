  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think Georgia Binks describes adequately my feelings on the recent backlash Belinda Stronach has received for &#8220;crossing the floor&#8221; from Tory to Liberal in the House of Commpns last week.  I really wonder, would a man be called  &#8220;an attractive dipstick&#8221; for changing sides?  While I&#8217;m generally up in the air with whether or not a politician SHOULD be allowed to change sides (some people voted for the party,  not the person), and given current turmoil am not sure what my political colour currently is on the federal scene, I think were it a male member who had done what Belinda did, they would not attack him based on ambition, or hint he that he is dumb.</p>

<p>Check out the opinion piece here:

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230; sipping your latte, dunking you vanilla-almond biscotti in the comfy chairs at Starbucks while Dave Matthews plays (over the speakers).  God, I&#8217;ve become pretentious!</p>

<p>But seriously, I&#8217;m having an up-and-down kind of week, so it was nice to spend some time &#8220;chilaxin&#8217;&#8221; as the kids say, with my love who has an interview today.  I&#8217;m <em>trying</em> to tie up all loose ends, catch up and be a responsible adult.  Speaking of which, good essay in today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20050518/FACTS18/TPComment/Features">Globe and Mail</a> on what happens to all that junk belonged to you that your parents saved - I know this day is coming for me.  And my parents are pack rats extreme.  It&#8217;s already happened for Brian.</p>

<p>But have a good hump-day.  Long weekend coming!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You know who you are.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve had quite a long relationship, longer than I can remember.  Even as a small child I knew you and appreciated your &#8220;beauty&#8221;.  Others scorned you, tried to get rid of you.  I called you &#8220;pretty&#8221;.  And you were - bright and warm from the start of spring, then you would grow white and fluffy and I had to help you out (I couldn&#8217;t resist) so that you could spread and grow.  We shared those care-free summer days, and it was nice.</p>

<p>But now things have changed.  You see, I now own a house, with a marvellous yard and beautiful trees and flowers.  Flowers planted with love by the previous owner.  I highly doubt you were part of her plan, but there you were, stubborn and refusing to leave, as we tried to tend to the garden just enough that the neighbours would not banish us, or dismiss us as poor home owners.  If we could get along, if you could only contain yourself to a small patch, that would be fine.  But already, you have claimed space in the flower gardens and on the lawn, space meant for the grass and flowers already there.  You&#8217;re waiting for the warmth the May and June will bring to bloom to full glory.  I was too naive, unaware last year to play a part this early in the season.  I&#8217;m not going to let you win this year.  You overstepped your territory, and I&#8217;m letting you know that we&#8217;re through.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been negligent.  Apologies.  Life is hectic, but not much is happening that&#8217;s worth explaining.  Trying to work the title-method of progress when it comes to research and prepping for this mini-enrichment course I&#8217;m doing with Grade 8-9 kids (it deals with Basic Electric Circuits - I just hope to God no one gets electricuted).  Plus reading co-op reports and trying to keep my nice clean house in order (I didn&#8217;t do the cleaning, I&#8217;ll admit to that).</p>

<p>I was in Saskatoon this past weekend for IEEE meetings.  Saskatoon is much nicer than expected, it&#8217;s not a void wasteland.  It IS flat - amazing to see a street that runs forever, mainly because there are no hills to interrupt it.  But it has a beautiful river (South Saskatchewan) with a nice trail.  It has friendly people who are more than willing to help.  It has at least one great hotel - we stayed at the Saskatoon Inn, which has quite comfy beds, a lush garden of a courtyard and a nice pool in the middle (it&#8217;s odd to be swimming in the courtyard, but nice).  It has a weird rock bar with a Kiss Tribute band and a coin-operated pool table.  Be careful when using the pool table - so friends got taken over and then booted off by a couple of questionably-aged girls.</p>

<p>The next few weeks are packed, so please don&#8217;t expect much from me when it comes to insight and depth (wait&#8230; I mean dribble and rambling).  I&#8217;ll be thinking about you though, while I stay afloat.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m tired a lot (low blood iron is my current &#8220;reason&#8221;), even though I get tons of sleep (Brian makes fun of me because I like to get 8 hours of sleep in a night).  I&#8217;ve developed a theory that those annoyingly energetic people you all know and hate, suck the energy from the rest of us.  It&#8217;s all pooled together, and some of us get the shalow end of it.  Today the energy vampires took the form of twelve 12-year-old boys (get your minds out of the gutters).  They were takin part in a mini-enrichment course that I was glad not to be running - my labmate Dilan was doing that.  But I was helping, and right around 2pm I felt like I would pass out.  Kids are soo tiresome, even when they aren&#8217;t being rambuncious.  How do parents manage it?  Mainlining heroin or speed?  Let me know the secret!  I want in!  I often wonder if I feel more tired than others, or if I&#8217;m just wussier than most.  I wonder the same for pain, because I think I have a lower tolerance for pain.  Is it physical (i.e. things actually hurt more for me than for others) or mental (i.e. it &#8220;hurts&#8221; the same, but I can&#8217;t take it?</p>

<p>For those of you who went to the &#8220;Just Letters&#8221; link (see below), I have a goal.  I&#8217;d love to get everyone &#8220;there&#8221; doing the same thing.  It&#8217;s really weird to think how to coordinate everyone when you have no real way of communicating, except these letters that others are fighting over.  That&#8217;s my goal, help me achieve it.</p>

<p>Okay, enough for now.  I am off to Saskatoon on Friday for IEEE Canada meetings.  I&#8217;m taking Diana&#8217;s advice and taking a walk, and maybe hitting a gallery or two, when I&#8217;m not in the middle of &#8220;discussions&#8221; and networking.  Let me know if you need me to bring you back something.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So&#8230; last night I put on my &#8220;IEEE Canada Lori&#8221; hat and began sending 3500 emails out to the masses (student members in Canada).  I decided to use GMail because it allowed my to paste the addresses in easier (they&#8217;re in an Excel file).  Well, after about 7 emails, each with a hundred recipients, GMail said &#8220;Wat a sec!  What&#8217;s this chick doing?&#8221;.  And now, I cannot send from my GMail account.</p>

<p>So, unless you&#8217;ve emailed me recently (I can reply to emails), don&#8217;t expect any GMail from me!</p>

<p>UPDATE:  I think the Google Gods have forgiven me.  Must have been my meta-tag offering.</p>
