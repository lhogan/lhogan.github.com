  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Newfoundland government released its annual budget yesterday.  I don&#8217;t claim to be (a) one who follows politcs all that much or (b) one who understands economics a heck of a lot, but this budget seems by and large good for the province.  For once, I can see myself pretty much immediately affected: my student loan interest rate will be going down, and the rate at which I am taxed by the province of Newfoundland on my income will be going down.  And that makes me happy.</p>

<p>As was probably the goal of the budget, to appease the voters before heading into a Fall 2007 election.  Some may view that as sinister, but let&#8217;s be fair&#8230; what government isn&#8217;t going to try such a tactic?</p>

<p>The only thing left to see is if (a) the promises actually stick beyond this year and (b) if this budget doesn&#8217;t put us further in a hole (there was even money allocated for debt payment, so I think they have that in mind).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Congrats to Brad, Randy, and all who I might have missed.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;The Sons of Martha&#8221;, by Rudyard Kipling</em></p>

<p>The Sons of Mary seldom bother, for they have inherited that good part;
But the Sons of Martha favour their Mother of the careful soul and  troubled heart.
And because she lost her temper once, and because she was rude to the  Lord her Guest,
Her Sons must wait upon Mary&#8217;s Sons, world without end, reprieve, or rest.</p>

<p>It is their care in all the ages to take the buffet and cushion the shock.
It is their care that the gear engages; it is their care that the  switches lock.
It is their care that the wheels run truly; it is their care to embark  and entrain,
Tally, transport, and deliver duly the Sons of Mary by land and main.</p>

<p>They say to mountains, &#8216;Be ye removed&#8217;. They say to the lesser floods,  &#8216;Be dry&#8217;.
Under their rods are the rocks reproved - they are not afraid of that  which is high.
Then do the hill-tops shake to the summit - then is the bed of the deep  laid bare,
That the Sons of Mary may overcome it, pleasantly sleeping and unaware.</p>

<p>They finger death at their gloves&#8217; end where they piece and repiece the  living wires.
He rears against the gates they tend: they feed him hungry behind their  fires.
Early at dawn, ere men see clear, they stumble into his terrible stall,
And hale him forth like a haltered steer, and goad and turn him till  evenfall.</p>

<p>To these from birth is Belief forbidden; from these till death is Relief  afar.
They are concerned with matter hidden - under the earthline their altars are;
The secret fountains to follow up, waters withdrawn to restore to the mouth,
And gather the floods as in a cup, and pour them again at a city drouth.</p>

<p>They do not preach that their God will rouse them a little before the  nuts work loose.
They do not teach that His Pity allows them to leave their work when they  damn-well choose.
As in the thronged and the lighted ways, so in the dark and the desert  they stand.
Wary and watchful all their days that their brethren&#8217;s days may be long  in the land.</p>

<p>Raise ye the stone or cleave the wood to make a path more fair or flat:
Lo, it is black already with blood some Son of Martha spilled for that:
Not as a ladder from earth to Heaven, not as a witness to any creed,
But simple service simply given to his own kind in their common need.</p>

<p>And the Sons of Mary smile and are blessed - they know the angels are on  their side.
They know in them is the Grace confessed, and for them are the Mercies  multiplied.
They sit at the Feet - they hear the Word - they see how truly the  Promise Runs:
They have cast their burden upon the Lord, and - the Lord He lays it on  Martha&#8217;s Sons.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Home, right now.  Enjoying Good Friday, as I hope everyone is, and hopefully a great Saturday and a wonderful Easter Sunday.</p>

<p>But soon (Monday evening, in fact) I am off to the Netherlands for business.  Back home late on the 16th (to a Brian-less house, as he is travelling to the Netherlands for business on the 13th&#8230; don&#8217;t worry, chances of us seeing eachother there are slim to none, the gods aren&#8217;t overlooking that one), and gone again for an IEEE meeting in Vancouver (yay, Div!) very early on the 20th.  (Brian returns later on the 20th.. again, the gods aren&#8217;t giving us THAT chance to see eachother either).  Barring bad weather, bad karma, etc., I&#8217;m back in town on the 23rd&#8230; just in time to go on vacation on the 27th (yay, Geoff!).  Back from THAT on May 6th, and no travel for at least a month.
So if anyone needs postcards, souvenirs, etc. please let me know!</p>

</a></p>

<p>I do like the adult cover, but I don&#8217;t particularly like the regular one&#8230; maybe it&#8217;s the black, or maybe it&#8217;s Hermoine&#8217;s hair. I can&#8217;t put my finger on the source of my dislike yet.  But who knows, maybe it will grow on me.  it&#8217;s certainly not going to stop me from being there in line at 12:01 (well, a few hours before that) on release day. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.padre.ca/house/blog/">House</a>&#8217;s recent recap of his resolutions made me go back to <a href="http://www.lorihogan.com/2007/01/01/another-new-year-another-set-of-resolutions/">my own</a>&#8230; and I realize I&#8217;m not gettin&#8217; very far.  Here&#8217;s my update&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I&#8217;ve been on and off the &#8220;healthy living&#8221; bandwagon since the start of the year, and as such I won&#8217;t be making my 15lb. loss mark before heading to see <a href="http://www.geoffholden.com">Geoff </a>in <a href="http://www.frommers.com/destinations/sanfrancisco/">Northern California</a>.  But despite work and IEEE travel between now and then, I will get back on it and stick with it.  I&#8217;ve got a bridesmaid dress to look good for <a href="http://www.ourcelebrationsite.ca/25august2007/index.cfm">in August</a>, and other things to get in shape for&#8230;</p></li>
<li><p><em>sigh</em> I&#8217;ve been doing decently with keeping my extra-curricular activities organized, though I haven&#8217;t kept it all to one night (I had designated Monday night as such).  But I need to do more to get on top of some of the bigger commitments, ie IEEE Canada.  Please, someone, nag me (not you House&#8230; I&#8217;m saving you for something else)&#8230; Randy?</p></li>
<li><p>Academics&#8230; huh?  What&#8217;s dat?  Ya, I&#8217;ve done little/nothing in the past three months in this area.  I&#8217;ve wanted to, but I haven&#8217;t put the energy into it.  And to be honest, I&#8217;m not gonna until at least after vacation&#8230;. but barring any extra work that comes up, I expect to be done my draft by the end of the year, and plan to use some of my four weeks annual leave to make that happen.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In other news, I spent the St. Patrick&#8217;s Day weekend in Boston at an IEEE meeting.  The meetings went well, socializing was fun (though I did not drink any green beer&#8230; instead I had a seafood hangover).  The trip home was a bit of a pain - delayed out of Boston meant landing in Montreal when the plane to St. John&#8217;s was supposedly taking off, rushed through customs and was told by the ticket lady (who wrangled us boarding passes after our flight had been &#8220;closed&#8221;) to run run run all the way to the gate.  Little old out of shape Lori (see first bullet point) is in extreme debt to Rob, who ran ahead to let them know we were coming&#8230; only to find that the plane had just gotten to the gate.  Argh.  So we made the flight with plenty of time, though my luggage didn&#8217;t, it came the next day.  Pics (of Boston, not of my luggage) to be posted soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was up horribly early this morning (B had to work @ 6am, I got into work by 7am, Lamp Shade and April didn&#8217;t seem to want to rest), and I&#8217;ll probably drop off sometime before supper.  But I&#8217;ve been pretty darn productive, IMO, since getting to work, knocking stuff off the proverbial To-Do list (note to self, start running commentary To-Do list like Dave).  Maybe I should try this early thing more often (somewhere, B is shuddering :P).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wesley had surgery on Tuesday past, an aggressive treatment (<a href="http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_lateral_ear_resection.html">lateral resection</a>) for an even more aggressive series of ear infections.  A check-up visit to the vet yesterday was positive; things are healing up nicely apparently.  But until he gets the stitches out on Friday, he must continue to wear the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_collar">Elizabethan collar</a>, a.k.a. the lamp shade, to avoid any scratching that may disturb the healing process.  He&#8217;s maneouvering decently these days, especially after Brian trimmed the cone.  But he still bumps into things and plows snow as he goes out to do his doggy business on the patio.  But he&#8217;s not very happy having it on, as you can see below.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got a new friend yesterday&#8230; his name is Farley and he&#8217;s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex_virus">cold sore</a> who is hanging out in the right corner of my mouth.  He grew fast&#8230; two nights ago he was just a mere tingle and then yesterday morning he was fully-grown (at least I hope he&#8217;s not getting any bigger).  He hasn&#8217;t said what drew him to me, I think it&#8217;s a combination of stress and flighting off some form of infection (hey, explains why I&#8217;m so freaking tired all the time).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m medicating him in hopes that, well, he goes away.  Not that I don&#8217;t like new friends, mind you.  But I think Farley&#8217;s become dependent on me, and I need to break the strings.  I hope he&#8217;ll understand.</p>
