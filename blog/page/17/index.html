  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, between you and me, I&#8217;ve really got to get my butt in gear.  I need to finish my Masters before losing sanity, like the way I may have lost an important small computer hardware piece that makes semi-expensive software work (a USB dongle, for the informed, a little purple one if you&#8217;ve seen it tell it to come home!).  I feel scattered right now, with ideas and things to try all over the place and though I&#8217;m doing my damnedest to get it all together, some days (like today) I&#8217;m not sure I can do it.  I know it&#8217;s not life and death&#8230; but it could be in terms of professional Lori.  I hate letting people down, or potentially letting them down&#8230; it&#8217;s something I fear worse than injury (but not worse than death).</p>

<p>But I get so distracted!  I&#8217;m like a raccoon with shiny things (did you know raccoons really like shiny things?), but my &#8220;shiny things&#8221; are activities like volunteerism, mindless computer games, and general time wasting.  Dreaming of trips that are far away in time&#8230; though fun, it&#8217;s not productive.</p>

<p>How the heck is one supposed to &#8220;do it all&#8221; AND stay healthy?  Huh?  Someone give me THAT little secret to life.  Even if I was more focused, after work/school, one or two hobbies or causes, family, and friends, who the hell has time to go to the gym?  Or cook properly every day?</p>

<p>Could someone tell me how to do it?  Please&#8230; Oooh!  Email&#8230;. (distracted by the little sound Microsoft Outlook makes, Lori forgot the rest of this blog entry&#8230; rest assured she&#8217;ll be back sometime in the next few weeks).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was having a kind of bad day earlier, but I think I&#8217;m over it now.  I went to Chapters, had some lemonade and looked at books.  I find Chapters, and indeed any book store really, to be a calming place.  I feel comfortable surrounded by books, most of whom I&#8217;ll never read but they&#8217;re all there in case I wanted to.  There is nothing better than curling up with a book and becoming absorbed into another world.</p>

<p>My two &#8220;dream&#8221; jobs, should I ever win the lottery or marry a rich man (or if the man I married becomes rich, love you hon!), would be to work at a book store or a travel agency.  I think it&#8217;s because both reading and travel involve escape - one to far-away places, the other an inner journey - both of which can satisfy when an escape is needed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s amazing that the people I&#8217;ve known the longest (i.e. my parents) are the ones I understand the least.  My mother in particular - she has lately been driving me mad, to the point that I nearly smacked my phone off the floor earlier in frustration.  She always (ALWAYS) calls around 9am each morning, and if I&#8217;m lucky I get an encore after lunch.</p>

<p>Typical morning conversation&#8230;
Me:&#8221;Hello?&#8221;
Her:&#8221;Hello, lovely morning isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
Me:&#8221;I guess so.(Note, at this point I&#8217;ve gone from house-car-school in sleepy stupor)&#8221;
Her:&#8221;What did you do after last night? (Because she calls home at around 8pm, she&#8217;s gotten the report up to then.)&#8221;
Me:&#8221;Not much, (one of) watched TV/saw a movie/played poker/did work/killed a man to watch him die (Honestly, I don&#8217;t think she listens to what I&#8217;m saying anyway).&#8221;
Her:&#8221;Did you see Canadian/American Idol?  That so-and-so, he&#8217;s some good.&#8221;
Me:&#8221;No, I don&#8217;t watch it (which she should know by now).&#8221;
Her:&#8221;I&#8217;ve got so-and-so today (Mom baby-sits).  We&#8217;re gonna go to the park and McDonalds.  Your father&#8217;s gone out for a walk, and he&#8217;s got to go pay some bills, and then we&#8217;re going to drop some mail over to your house.  Well, ohhhhhkayyyyyy, gotta go bye.&#8221;
Me:&#8221;Talk to you later.&#8221;
Her:&#8221;Ohhhhhhkayyyyyyy, bye, did you know&#8230; (proceeds with something related to a murder in Mozambique or a kidnapping of triplets in Kentucky).&#8221;
Me:&#8221;Yup, read that on CNN (maybe, I just want to get on with my day!).&#8221;
Her:&#8221;Ohhhkayyyy, bye.&#8221;
Me:&#8221;Bye&#8221;.
Her:&#8230; well, sometimes the call can continue in this fashion for another minute or so</p>

<p>Typical mid-day conversation&#8230;
Me:&#8221;Hello?&#8221;
Her:&#8221;Helllooooo, were you out earlier?&#8221;
Me:&#8221;Yes (annoyance creeping in - how many times did she call?), why?&#8221;
Her:&#8221;Just calling to say it&#8217;s a lovely day, isn&#8217;t it? Me and so-and-so went for a walk and played in the park, and went to McDonalds.  Now he/she is lied down on the couch.&#8221;
Me:&#8221;Sounds nice.&#8221;
Her:&#8221;Well, ohhhhkayyyy, talk to you later.&#8221;
Me:&#8221;Yup.  Talk to you later.&#8221;
Her:&#8221;Ohhhkayyyy. (Hang up)&#8221;.</p>

<p>ARGH!  Why?  Why call and have the same conversation twice a day?  Nothing exciting happens in my life (between breakfast and lunch I didn&#8217;t run away and join the circus) and nothing new happened in her life in that four-hour period!  I realize she&#8217;s bored, possibly a little lonely because she doesn&#8217;t have many/any friends, but I&#8217;ve resorted to holding the phone slightly away and saying &#8220;Yup&#8221; in the pauses.</p>

<p>How do I deal?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Spent part of last night at the wake of a friend of B&#8217;s family (which, I guess, makes him a friend of my family - it definitely takes a while to think of all the in-laws as &#8220;family&#8221;).  Mr. Murphy was well-known and loved by many friends and family.  Though I didn&#8217;t know him that well, I was kind of shocked at his suddent death.  We saw him only a few days before playing golf at the Pitch &#8216;n&#8217; Putt, and now&#8230; it puts certain things into perspective.</p>

<p>I ran into my aunt at a Regatta Day sale; she&#8217;s been having a tough time lately, her mother and several aunts/uncles are ill, and one uncle passed away last week.  As we were parting, I gave her a hug and kiss on the cheek (I&#8217;m not normally that type of person, but she needed it).  Well, my aunt appreciated it (I think) but my uncle seemed kind of embarassed; his reaction seemed basically, &#8220;We don&#8217;t show emotion, what are hell are you doing?&#8221;.</p>

<p>Well, that raises my question/quandry&#8230; why DON&#8217;T we show more emotion?  Some think it&#8217;s weak, but really I think being able to show you care makes a person strong.  My own mom finds it&#8217;s amazing that after all the years of being married, my parents-in-law still hold hands when walking.  But they love each other - why should the number of anniversaries you&#8217;ve celebrated affect the way they show emotion?</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m going to be unlike the rest of my family and try to show what I&#8217;m feeling, try and reach out if I feel someone needs it.  And I don&#8217;t care who sees.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been quite fortunate in life.  I&#8217;m healthy, live in a democratic country where I have rights and freedoms, have many good friends and a husband and family who love me.  And I have bananas&#8230; anyone with bananas is a lucky, lucky person.</p>

<p>But some people think I have a horseshoe stuck up&#8230; where the sun don&#8217;t shine.  Throughout my academic career I received several well-sized scholarships.  I&#8217;ve been fortunate to get a lot of good work terms, and now I&#8217;m finishing out my position on the IEEE Canada Board that could have gone to many others.  Some may call that luck, some may call that reward for hard-work/brains.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m smart&#8230; so I&#8217;m inclined to go with &#8220;a little from column A, a little from column B&#8221; in response to that one.</p>

<p>Then there are things that have no explanation.  I&#8217;m fairly good at winning radio contests and have gotten movie passes, free pool, and tickets for a cover band a chance to win a trip to see the Eagles.  I also have a knack for winning prizes at baby/wedding showers.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also the internet.  I know, &#8220;Nobody wins anything on the internet&#8230;&#8221;, but I do.  Substantial stuff.  Like a classical music CD!  And, in 2002, a train trip for two across Canada courtesy of Via Rail, that myself and B enjoyed immensely - everyone should take the train through the Rockies once in life.</p>

<p>My latest win is from Air Canada&#8217;s &#8220;Win the Whole World&#8221; contest.  A weekly contest, the Grand Prize was a trip for two in Executive class anywhere they fly.  I didn&#8217;t win that one.  What I did won was tickets for two to Australia&#8230; we plan to go next March/April for two weeks or so.</p>

<p>But am I lucky, or is it karma?  I try to be a good person (well, to everyone but my mother, who really deserves better).  I try to help out when I can, whether it be my time or skills or money/donations.  I would like to think that being this good person (trying anyway) shifts the cosmos in my favour from time to time.  But it probably doesn&#8217;t.  But wouldn&#8217;t that be cool, if by being a better person, better things would happen to you?  Wouldn&#8217;t that be the way to change the world, by prescribing everyone to help out their neighbour or take up a cause and see life improve.</p>

<p>Wait&#8230; that sounds good anyway.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I braved the crowds at Chapters Friday night (and let&#8217;s just say that it was at the height of disorganization - apparently pre-orders were supposed to pick up bracelets at a mysterious talbe surrounded by people waiting to pick up their books, and other people had tickets with numbers on them, waiting to buy the book&#8230; it was so much better last time, but last time there wasn&#8217;t the &#8216;hoopla&#8217; of the kid getting the first book in North America).</p>

<p>What book?  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, of course. Over the course of Friday night (only read the +first three chapters) and Saturday, I finished the book and it&#8217;s now in the trusted hands of Geoff.</p>

<p>My opinion?  This one is excellent.  Not my favorite (Book Three, Prisoner of Azkaban, fills that spot.  But it&#8217;s a better book than the last two.  And it&#8217;s certainly not just for kids anymore&#8230; the concepts, the betrayals, the death, the multiple plots and the final task are all stuff from adult literature.  Oh, there&#8217;s some kids stuff in there too, and now that they are getting older there&#8217;s a bit of romance and making out.  But this book has brought the level up&#8230; and the next book is going to be totally different than any of the others.</p>

<p>I have some ideas of what&#8217;s going to happen in the next (and is it the last?) book.  Well, I think I do - I could be proven totally wrong.  But I&#8217;ll just have to anxiously wait.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m not ashamed to admit I&#8217;m a fan of Harry Potter.  I started reading the books in the boredom that was Belleville and my third work term.  Lucky for me, Belleville has a Chapters, and I have a love of reading.  I bought and then devoured the first three of the series (Philosopher&#8217;s Stone, Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban) several times over four months.  Number Four (Goblet of Fire) was purchased in paper back as soon as it was available, and was read one weekend I really should have been for an electromagnetics final.  Number Five (Order of the Phoenix) was purchased in hard cover at midnight the day it was released and read in an 8-hour sitting.  Now I wait for midnight tonight for Number Six, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been called geeky, childish and odd.  Yes, I&#8217;ve bought both forms (children&#8217;s and adult) of the soft-cover books.  Yes, I&#8217;ve given my hard-cover versions away because I don&#8217;t have a complete set anyway.  Yes, I&#8217;ve read each book about five times by now.  But a girl needs a hobby, doesn&#8217;t she?</p>

<p>Part of my like is that I was a big-time reader as a child.  I spent a lot of time in the car with my parents, so I would read. I had a small library of Baby-Sitters Club books in the backseat with me. I still like to read for recreation when I have the time.  I know that if these books had come out 10-15 years ago, I would have been a devoted fan.  It&#8217;s a little bit of nostalgia.  The books are fun in a way &#8220;adult fiction&#8221; is not, but they are not necessarily &#8220;kiddie&#8221;.  We&#8217;re dealing with fantasy, yes, but there is also some great imagery and some very &#8220;adult&#8221; ideas and struggles.</p>

<p>The movies are fun too, but I prefer the books.  When reading you can picture it yourself, you can roll words around in your head&#8230; up until the first movie, I had &#8220;Hermoine&#8221; sounding a whole lot different than it actually does.  Even the movies have not totally imprinted the sight of Hogwarts or the characters within on me.</p>

<p>So you&#8217;ll find me at Chapters tonight at midnight, book in hand and first chapters consumed before bed.  I won&#8217;t skip to the end to find out what happens (as I am tempted to do - get the book, read the end in the store and loudly proclaim, &#8220;Dumbledore is dead!&#8221;).  And I&#8217;m not going to write about who dies, or what happens.  You have to read it, in my opinion, to find out for yourself.</p>

<p>For the &#8220;good Catholic&#8221;, check out this.</p>
