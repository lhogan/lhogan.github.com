  <div class="entry-content"><p>I feel very anticipatory right now, but I have nothing really to anticipate.  Thus, I&#8217;m kind of sad/down/depressed when I think about it.  Might be the extra caffeine I injected into my body earlier to combat the 4pm tireds&#8230; might be this work report I&#8217;m trying to finish on a project that once again I&#8217;ve under-performed in.  But hey, what else is new?</p>

<p>Generally lately I&#8217;ve determined I have a very self-defeatist attitude.  Most things I start I don&#8217;t expect to finish, or complete satisfactorily - for some reason, I&#8217;ve usually assumed everyone takes that same approach to life, but more and more I find I&#8217;m wrong (great, another thing I can&#8217;t do right).  I mean, in my head I <em>know</em> I&#8217;ve done some good and successful things in my life (marriage to a wonderful dude, graduating, jobs, scholarships, overcome fear of driving, done some good things in volunteer positions I&#8217;ve held), but most days the only thoughts that come to me are about the stupid things I&#8217;ve done and said, or the things that haven&#8217;t gone right.  Or sometimes I think that the things I&#8217;ve excelled at are flukes, luck or because people like me.</p>

<p>Somedays I think that self-defeatism is what&#8217;s throwing me off from FINALLY finishing the masters.  I also think that&#8217;d part of the reason I&#8217;ve failed to complete the diving course - when the minor things go wrong (feet not in drysuit boots, normal tiredness) I see it as the sign I&#8217;m not meant to do it, and I give up (I&#8217;ll have some pics from this weekend&#8217;s course that Brian successfully finished (love you honey!)).  I try and try again, but sometimes I only think that&#8217;s because what&#8217;s expected of me (not necesarily with the diving thing, but with life in general).  I&#8217;m doing okay with the weight loss/fitness plan, but I&#8217;m not sure if I really believe I can stay at an ideal weight and keep myself in shape.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know how to shake this funk, because it&#8217;s generally been part of me since I-don&#8217;t-know-when&#8230; only difference is that I think it&#8217;s grown as life gets less easy.  I mean, I&#8217;ve read some self-help articles on positive self-talk, make a list of the good things so hen you start getting negative you can refer to it, be nice to yourself for five minutes straight&#8230; but to be honest, it all seems like crap.  So to does the &#8220;blame it on XXX&#8221; school of thought.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be okay.. sorry for bring y&#8217;all down in my pity party.  I&#8217;m not normally this negative, and I&#8217;ll try not be in future.  I just needed to get it out, maybe my own form of therapy.  Okay, that&#8217;s done.  Onward and upward?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In October, I was supposed to attend a Student Congress in Cancun.  The day before I was to leave, it got hit by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Wilma">Huuricane Wilma</a>.  Such is life&#8230;</p>

<p>So how come, the day I book airline tickets to go from Sydney, Australia to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairns">Cairns</a> , a gateway to the Great Barrier Reef, the area (well, to be fair, slightly south of the area - but only by 100km) gets hit by &#8220;the biggest storm ever to hit the country&#8217;s Pacific coast&#8221;??</p>

<p>Meet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Larry">Larry</a>.</p>

<p>At least he came a month before I got there&#8230; maybe there&#8217;ll be some clown fish or something for us to see.  Hey, maybe they&#8217;ll be onland!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s International Woman&#8217;s Day today. Here&#8217;s hoping for equality!  I was reading a bit today about Harper&#8217;s child-care policy.  I&#8217;m not sure what I think of it.  But it scares the crap out of me that so many people believe that a woman&#8217;s place is at home.  If that&#8217;s your choice, that&#8217;s great, and who knows, it may be one I will make when we have kids.  But that is a choice, and one every woman should get to make.  I&#8217;ve been observing, quietly, and from what I see, it&#8217;s still the &#8220;woman&#8217;s role&#8221; to take care of the kids.. at least, that&#8217;s what I see.   Maybe it&#8217;s just the people around me, but it&#8217;s a little disheartening. Time will tell&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m headed to San Francisco on Friday morning, to attend the IEEE RAB GOLD meeting as Region 7 rep.   I&#8217;ve never been there.  It&#8217;s a new committee for me, I&#8217;ve been a bit slow on the uptake this time but will get into the swing of it and be a good rep for my region.  I&#8217;ll get to see some old faces though (old meaning not new, not old as in oooooooooooolllllllld) , as the SAC committee meets at the same time.  Plus, I get to see Geoff after the two weeks I haven&#8217;t seen him.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dear God.  I just finished watching &#8220;Larry King Live&#8221;.  Sir Paul McCartney and his lovely wife were debating with Danny Williams on the seal hunt.  The McC&#8217;s are here in Canada on behalf on US Humane Society to protest the hunt based on its cruelty.  Danny, on behalf on Canada, was trying to set him straight on a few things.  Larry the Owl was moderating.</p>

<p>Note to celebrities:  if you&#8217;re gonna jump on a cause, learn about it first.  Paul seems fairly reasonable, though a little misled by the Humane Society.  Heather compared the seal hunt to a war, said that there needed to be peace talks to stop the hunt, refused to believe people don&#8217;t eat seals.  Argued that the income from the hunt is minimal to those who hunt them, said Harper would care because these are &#8220;harp&#8221; seals (WHAT???), and then, when she couldn&#8217;t come up with anything else, accused Danny WIlliams of acting like a politician.</p>

<p>You may be against hunting seals&#8230; and that&#8217;s your opinion.  But make sure you&#8217;ve got your facts straight!!</p>

<p>Argh.  You can read the transcript here: <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0603/03/lkl.01.html">http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0603/03/lkl.01.html</a></p>
